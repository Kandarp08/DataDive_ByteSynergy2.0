Income, Employment and Poverty
Introduction
Poverty has received special policy focus among
the international development goals accepted by
the UN member countries on the eve of the new
millennium. In fact, it is the first and foremost
goal specified in the Millennium Development
Goals. The goal is to reduce poverty by half
between the base year 1990, and the reference
year, 2015. What is most important here is the
explicit recognition that poverty has multiple
dimensions, with implications for opportunities,
security and empowerment. Any discussion
on poverty during the new millennium must,
therefore, focus on the different dimensions of
deprivation and their policy implications before
attempting to evaluate policy efforts to deal
with them. This chapter will highlight issues
relating to poverty, income and employment in
Karnataka along with policy efforts to deal with
these issues.

Income distribution and
income poverty: Institutional
parameters
Income and consumption distribution, and
the incidence of income poverty depend on
the distribution of assets and employment
opportunities for utilising the only endowment of
the asset-less rural poor, i.e. labour, and its price,
viz. real wage rate. Hence, this section will examine
the situation in rural Karnataka with respect to
these factors that have critical implications for
income distribution and poverty.
The sectoral distribution of state income shows a
decline in the share of the primary sector from
38.10 per cent in 1993-94 to 20.90 per cent
in 2003-04. The secondary sector’s share
has increased marginally, from 24 per cent in
1993-94 to 25.5 per cent in 2003-04. There
is, however, a significant increase in the share of
the tertiary sector, with 37.9 per cent in 1993-94
increasing to nearly 54 per cent in 2003-04,
contributing to more than half of the state’s
income.

The average area of operational holdings1
in Karnataka in 1991-92 was 1.85 hectare
(ha.), which was higher than the all-India
estimate of 1.34 ha. The extent of inequality
in the distribution of operational holdings, as
measured by the Gini ratio, was 0.609 (0.641)
in rural Karnataka (all-India). Available estimates
indicate an increase in the extent of inequality
between three time-points in rural Karnataka
as well as in rural all-India (Table 4.2).
During the same period, the percentage of
marginal holdings increased from 28.76
per cent (45.77 per cent) to 38.40 per cent (56.00
per cent), and finally, to 49.71 per cent (62.79
per cent) in rural Karnataka (rural all-India);
the corresponding estimates of area operated
were 5.10 per cent (9.21 per cent), 5.80
per cent (11.50 per cent) and 9.56 per cent
(15.60 per cent) respectively (NSSO 1997).
The distributional perspective indicates that
the percentage of tenant holdings is low in
Karnataka (8.0 per cent in 1991-92) relative
to the all-India level (11.0 per cent) (NSSO
1997). This is an outcome of the land reforms
implemented in the 1980s. However, from
the perspective of vulnerability (a major focus
of any debate on deprivation), the percentage

1

Poverty is the first and
foremost goal specified
in the Millennium
Development Goals.

The NSS defines an operational holding as a techno-economic
unit used wholly or partly for agricultural production and
operated (directed/managed) by one person alone, or with the
assistance of others, without regard to title, size or location. The
unit may consist of one or more parcels of land and would be
comprehensive with respect to land, agricultural equipments,
machinery and draught animals etc.

of irrigated operated area was as low as

all-India average of 35.39 per cent in 1991-92

agricultural production and productivity, as well
as for poverty and deprivation.

The economic profile of the population by different
occupational categories, their relative importance
and their differential participation in the growth
process provides invaluable inputs for poverty
reduction policies. Such a profile can be explained
with the help of important measures of the quality
of life such as monthly per capita consumer
expenditure (MPCE), incidence of poverty and
relative inequality in levels of living. The relative
importance of each occupational group from
the perspective of equity can be assessed with
reference to its relative size, i.e. its percentage
share in the total population. Estimates of all
the relevant parameters are provided in Table
4.3. Some major features of the profiles by
occupational categories are presented in Box 4.1.

BOX 4.1

Major features of occupational categories
1. Agricultural labour households constitute the largest segment and account for 40 per cent
of the total population in rural Karnataka.The average level of consumption of this segment
is the lowest. The extent of relative inequality in consumption is also low. Accordingly, the
incidence of poverty among agricultural labour households is the highest across different
occupational groups. Variations in real wages and district poverty estimates are closely
interlinked, providing good inputs for strategies for improving the levels of living of the
poor.
2. The self-employed in agriculture constitute the second largest segment (38 per cent). Its
average consumption level being relatively higher, its incidence of poverty is the second
lowest in rural Karnataka. Agricultural labour households, together with the self-employed
in agriculture, constitute the bulk (78 per cent) of the rural population.
3. In urban Karnataka, the regular wage/salary earning class constitutes the largest
occupational group. It is also the richest in terms of measures of average consumption and
deprivation; incidence of poverty in this group is a mere 14.43 per cent. Casual labour
households, though accounting for less than a sixth of total urban population, constitute
the poorest segment. Their average consumption is the lowest and more than half of them
are poor.

76

Rate of growth and regional
disparities
Karnataka’s economy grew at the rate of 4.8
per cent per annum during the decade of the
1980s, i.e. at a rate less than the all-India average
of 5.4 per cent (World Bank, 2002c). However, its
growth rate picked up in the 1990s when it reached
6.9 per cent and exceeded the all-India average
(6.1 per cent).
Between 1993-94 and 2003-04, the state’s
manufacturing and service sectors grew at 7.50
and 10.61 per cent respectively (Table 4.4), while
the primary sector grew at a relatively lower rate
of 0.61 per cent per annum. During this period,
the economy as a whole grew at a rate of 6.84
per cent per annum and the average growth rate
of per capita income has been commendable at
5.30 per cent per annum.
Consequently, Karnataka’s share in the total
GDP of the nation increased from 4.8 per cent
in 1990-91 to 5.22 per cent in 2001-02 (GoK,
Economic Survey 2002-03). In 2002-03, the

prices (Rs.19,865) was higher than the national
average (Rs.18,912) (GoK, Economic Survey
2004-05).
Karnataka is marked by strong regional disparities.
Bangalore Urban and Dakshina Kannada emerged
as the most developed districts in 1980-81
(Iyengar and Sudarshan, 1983) with Kodagu,
Shimoga, Dharwad and Belgaum following
closely behind. Bellary, Mandya, Chikmaglur,
Mysore, Chitradurga, Uttara Kannada and Kolar
were in the developing category. Hassan, Tumkur
and Bijapur were the backward districts. Three
Hyderabad Karnataka districts, viz. Raichur, Bidar

and Gulbarga, emerged as the most backward
districts of Karnataka. By 2001-02, Bangalore
Urban, Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Bangalore
Rural, Udupi, Mysore and Chikmaglur were
generating a per capita domestic product higher
than the state average (Table 4.5). The city of
Bangalore alone contributed about 22 per cent
of the state income; Bangalore Rural and Urban
districts together generated a quarter of the state
income.These two districts share nearly 16 per cent
of the state’s population in 2001. Bijapur, along
with the Hyderabad Karnataka triumvirate of
Bidar, Gulbarga and Raichur continued to be
in the poorest quartile in terms of per capita
domestic product. The pattern of growth over two

decades indicates a stratification of districts based
on geographic location, with the northern districts
consistently performing poorly. This has serious
implications for the distribution of poverty across
districts.

Labour productivity: Regional
dimensions

An encouraging trend is
the fact that out of the
seven districts which have
experienced growth rates
higher than the state
average, Koppal, Gadag,
Haveri and Bagalkot are
in north Karnataka.
78

Estimates of the level of labour productivity and
its growth are important indicators of poverty
and human development. They measure the
potential for improvement in the quality of life
of the people. Estimates of labour productivity
for all the 27 districts for the year 2000-01
(Table 4.6) reveal that labour productivity was
highest in Bangalore Urban district, followed by
Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts in 1991,
and these districts retained their ranking in 2001
as well (except Kodagu). It may be noted that all
districts (except Dharwad) in north Karnataka
had labour productivity below the state average
in 1991 and 2001. While Haveri district had the

lowest labour productivity in 1991, followed by
Tumkur and Koppal districts, in 2001 Raichur
had the lowest labour productivity, followed by
Tumkur and Haveri districts. The relative ranking
of Raichur district has come down from 17 in
1991 to 27 in 2001. The annual compound
growth of labour productivity was the highest in
Bangalore Rural, followed by Bangalore Urban
between 1991 and 2001. Other districts which
have growth rates higher than the state average
(5.30) are Koppal, Mysore, Gadag, Haveri and
Bagalkot. An encouraging trend is the fact that
out of the seven districts which have experienced
growth rates higher than the state average,
Koppal, Gadag, Haveri and Bagalkot are in north
Karnataka.

Migration
According to the NSS data on migration for
the year 1999-2000, about 27 per cent of the
state’s population is migrant. The proportion of
migration in urban Karnataka is 33 per cent as

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

compared to 26 per cent migrant population in
rural areas. Among the total migrants, female
migrants (77 per cent) outnumber male migrants
(23 per cent) significantly. However, the proportion
of females who migrate for reasons of employment
is significantly lower than males. A high percentage
of migrants, 57.3 per cent of urban and 34.2
per cent of rural migrants, are males who migrated
in search of employment contrasted with only
3.9 per cent urban females and 1.8 per cent
rural females.

Trends in wages and prices
Agricultural labourers constitute the bulk of the
rural poor in Karnataka. Their endowment of
assets is virtually nil; hence, their level of living
depends upon their income earning potential,
as reflected in the available employment
opportunities and real wages for unskilled labour.
Available estimates indicate that average real
wages (i.e. nominal wages adjusted for increase
in cost-of-living reported by the Consumer
Price Index for Agricultural Labourers) in rural
Karnataka in December 2004 exceeded the level
in the agricultural year (AY) 1993-94 by about
47 per cent for men and 35.4 per cent for women
respectively (Table 4.7). When compared with the
base period of 1993-94, real wages for women
are lower by 12 percentage points as compared
to men.
There are wide variations across districts in the
changes in real wages in comparison with the
base period, 1993-94. Dharwad has registered
the highest increase in real wages for men
between 1993-94 and 2003-04 (161 per cent)
followed by Haveri (156 per cent). Kodagu has
experienced negative changes in real wages for
men, while Kolar and Mandya have experienced
no change in real wages for men. Changes in
real wages for women during this period are the
highest in Haveri district (203 per cent), followed
by 100.56 per cent in Dharwad, while Mandya has
experienced negative changes. The above analysis
shows that real wages for men have increased
substantially more than the wages for women
during the period from 1993-94 to December
2004. This trend is discussed in greater detail in
the chapter on gender.

Income deprivation
A crucial aspect of material deprivation is income
deprivation, which is examined in terms of
estimates of poverty based on the National Sample
Survey on household consumer expenditure
distribution, which is generally used as a proxy for
income distribution.

Estimates reveal a reduction in the number
of the poor from 156.45 lakh in 1993-94 to
104.40 lakh in 1999-2000 in Karnataka, i.e. by
about 33 per cent (Table 4.8). This performance
is much better than the all-India reduction by
18.8 per cent (from 3,203.68 lakh to 2,602.50
lakh) during the same period. As a proportion
80

of the population, poverty in Karnataka declined
from 33.16 to 20.04 per cent (reduction of about
13 percentage points) as against the all-India
decline from 35.97 to 26.10 per cent (reduction
of 10 percentage points) during the same period.
As a result of economic growth and the poverty
reduction strategies of the government, the state
is moving towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. The government must,
however, ensure that the process of growth and
poverty alleviation policies continues and the
disparities of caste, gender and region addressed
at the grassroots level.
Table 4.9 shows that in 1993-94, Kodagu, with
its per capita domestic product of Rs.13,718
was first among all the districts, while in 19992000 Bangalore Urban is first with Rs.25,740.
Bidar continues as the poorest performer in the
list of 20 districts, though its per capita domestic
product increased by 46 per cent during this
period. Head count ratio indicates that in 1993-94,
Bidar had the highest percentage of poor people
(56.1 per cent). Bangalore Rural has seen a
tremendous decline in its head count ratio from
38.2 per cent in 1993-94 to 5.2 per cent in 19992000. One interesting point to note is that in
Raichur, the head count ratio has, indeed, increased
subsequently.This is an important area where state
policy will have to take remedial steps.

Poverty and levels of living by social
groups
This section provides a profile across different
social groups (Table 4.10). The Scheduled Caste
(SC) households account for about 20 per cent
of the rural population. Together with Scheduled
Tribe (ST) households, they form nearly 28 per cent
of the rural population. These two social categories
have the lowest levels of average consumption
and the highest incidence of poverty. About 25
per cent of their respective populations is poor. In
urban Karnataka, the combined population share
of the SCs and STs is about 15 per cent. Nearly
half of these two social categories are poor, whereas
this proportion comes to only a sixth for other
households.Thus, there exists a sharp gap between
these social groups and the rest of the population in
terms of improvements in levels of living.

the ground reality as well as potential for human
development of both, the individual and society.
Children from poor households perform poorly
relative to those from non-poor households with
respect to food security, health and education.
Therefore, estimates of the incidence of child
poverty are useful in that they indicate the
percentage of children living in misery with
a bleak future. Hence, this parameter has
policy implications in terms of policy design,
regional targeting and budgetary support. Some
estimates of the magnitude of child poverty
in rural and urban Karnataka are presented in
Table 4.11.
Poverty is defined and estimated with reference to
consumption which is measured at the household
level. In other words, child poverty could be
defined as the proportion of children living in
consumption-poor households. Estimates for
the year 1999-2000 show that the incidence of
child poverty is about the same in both rural and
urban sectors, across India as a whole. However,
the incidence of child poverty in urban areas is
twice that of the rural levels in Andhra Pradesh
and Kerala. In Karnataka, about 23 per cent
of the rural child population lives in poor
households while the incidence of urban child
poverty is one and a half times that of the rural
areas (Table 4.11).

Child labour
Among the remaining social groups, ‘Other
Backward Communities’ (OBCs) constitute
39 per cent of the rural population, of whom
16 per cent are below the poverty line, which
is significantly lower than the proportion of poor
among the SCs and STs. In urban Karnataka
OBCs constitute about 31 per cent of the urban
population and nearly 30 per cent of them are
poor – a proportion almost double that of their
rural counterparts.

Child poverty
A subset of the poor that calls for policy attention
with regard to all the multiple parameters of
deprivation is that of ‘children under 15’. Child
poverty will have a lasting adverse impact on

Child labour is a manifestation of household
poverty, which is exploited by employers who
do not wish to pay adult wages. Child labour
is a violation of child as well as human rights.
It stunts the development of the child during
his/her crucial learning years and leads to
irreparable physical and psychological damage,
impairing for life, his/her opportunities for
social mobility. Child labour also creates a
vicious cycle of illiteracy and low income, while
simultaneously depriving adults of employment
and higher wages. The prevalence of child labour
also deprives the nation of an educated, skilled
and productive workforce which could form the
basis of rapid economic growth. Thus, employing
children robs them of their childhood and stunts
the growth of the nation.

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

The absolute number of child labour in India
was estimated to be about 12.59 million,2 with
a labour force participation rate of more than 5
per cent according to the 2001 census, with
Karnataka contributing 8.23 lakh as compared to
9.76 lakh child labour in 1991. However, when
compared to the neighbouring states of Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, it is evident that
Karnataka has the second highest child work
participation rate of 13.9 per cent, next only to
Andhra Pradesh, which has 17.8 per cent.
If enrolment and dropout data for the past seven
years, based on the Education Department’s
statistics are considered (1996-97 to 2003-04), a
total of 97.9 lakh children were enrolled in class I
over the last seven years, and 18.39 lakh children
dropped out, which constitutes 18.78 per cent
of the total children enrolled. In addition, 45.54
per cent of children failed to complete eight years
of compulsory schooling. If we go by the definition
that ‘any child out of school is a child labourer’,
then 45 per cent of the children in Karnataka are
child labourers for some period of their childhood
and 18 per cent are child labourers at any given
point of time. Though the percentage of dropouts
may be decreasing, the absolute numbers of
out-of-school children are still large.
According to the National Family Health SurveyIndia (1998-99) for Karnataka, conducted by the
International Institute for Population Sciences,
cultural attitudes, such as lack of interest in
education or child marriage, accounted for the
main reason, for an average of 43.4 per cent of
the responses, for not enrolling children or taking
them out of school. Poverty related reasons, such
as ‘the child is required to work’ or ‘schooling costs
too much’, accounted for 36.18 per cent of the
responses. School-related reasons, such as ‘the
school is too far away’ or ‘school facilities are not
adequate’ were cited by 10.65 per cent of the
respondents.
The distribution pattern of child labour across
different sectors indicates that child work

sectoral distribution pattern of child labour shows
that child workers are employed primarily in
the unorganised farm sector and their collective
share as cultivators and agricultural labourers is
more than three-fourth of the total child labour
population (Table 4.13).
Thus, there is an urgent need for intensive and
concerted efforts to not only target working
children and motivate them to attend school
and complete at least eight years of elementary
education, but also provide institutional
arrangements and support to facilitate this
process.
In the current economy, there are emerging
demands for child labour from new sectors. For
instance, while child labour in the silk-twisting
sector has been decreasing, it has been increasing

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

in the hybrid cotton seed producing sector, as a
result of a shift from subsistence agriculture to
commercial crop production. The service industry
and floriculture are other sectors where child
labour is increasing steadily under the impact of
global markets. Domestic labour is another area
where there is much abuse and exploitation.

State interventions
Despite several interventions, the impact of
government programmes on the prevalence of
child labour has not been satisfactory for various
reasons. The focus, so far, has been on a welfare
approach and on persuasion, exhortation and
incentives, rather than a rights-based approach.
Further, a strategy to address the causes at
source has not received the same attention as
a curative approach. Policies concentrate on
rehabilitation through universal enrolment and
retention. This has made rehabilitation an endless
exercise since the school system has continued to
leak fresh dropouts, even as earlier dropouts are
rehabilitated. Dropouts occur as a result of both
pull-out and push-out factors. The supply side
(pull-out) causes, namely (i) poverty; (ii) poor
enforcement of the law on compulsory education;
and (iii) illiteracy and ignorance, have not been
adequately addressed. The Education Department
has no mechanism for addressing issues of poverty
and child labour, which are the main reasons cited
by parents and children for never enrolling or
dropping out of school. The Karnataka Education
Act has no mechanisms or procedures to assist
parents who may be disabled, ill or otherwise
dependent on a child’s income. The Education
Act also offers no solution to the large numbers
of children who migrate with their parents for
employment. There are several new initiatives to
bring working children back to school and they
have been successful, but sustained environmentbuilding activities to dispel the illiteracy and
ignorance that justifies child labour are also
required. Entrenched attitudes, which justify poor
children working for a living, are still common,
even among the elite. The attitude of rationalising
child labour as ‘inevitable’ and a ‘necessary evil’, is
yet to disappear. A large percentage of employers
continue to see their employment of children as a
‘favour’ they are doing to the children and their

families to help them survive. The belief that it
is alright for a poor child to earn full time and
learn for a few hours is held by far too many
people. Therefore, while parents may agree that
education is desirable, they are often unable or
unwilling to send their children to school. The
idea that education should lead to a job in the
organised sector, preferably government, is also
held by many parents. Gender bias that says that

girl children will end up as housewives and need
not be educated means that girls are pulled out
of school to work. Existing child labour laws do
not cover the so-called non-hazardous sectors,
such as agriculture, domestic and home-based
work and the informal sector, where more than
90 per cent of children work3. There is, thus, a
contradiction between the law on compulsory
education and the child labour law. There are
also contradictions between these two laws on
the magnitude of punishments for employers of
children. There are currently no inspectors under
the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of
1976, and hence, hardly any identifications of,
and punishment for, practising child bonded
labour. The Children (Pledging of Labour) Act of
1933 is also rarely invoked for freeing pledged
children even though pledging and bondage of
children are very common practices. The Action
Plan on Child Labour has remained a broad policy
document and a ‘statement of intent’. It needs to

be disaggregated into action points with concrete
physical and financial targets on a priority basis.

Targets for poverty reduction:
Tenth Five Year Plan
Karnataka is committed to the Millennium
Development Goals as well as theTenth Plan goals.
One of these goals is to reduce income poverty by
50 per cent between 1990 and 2015. The Tenth
Five Year Plan has been formulated keeping this
goal in mind. The Tenth Plan seeks to bring down
poverty in Karnataka to 7.85 per cent by the year
2007 (Table 4.14).

Employment
The employment scenario can be examined
from different angles, depending upon the policy
perspective and emphasis. For instance, the size
distribution of the workforce across age groups
throws light on the size of child labour force
and its policy imperatives. Data on the mode of
employment highlights policy implications for
social security, particularly for the vulnerable,
casual labour. A profile of the sectoral distribution
of the workforce is critical for an assessment of
the relative importance of various employment
opportunities.

Work participation rate
With the growth in population, there has been
an increase in the work participation rate in the
economy. The work participation rate increased
from 40.2 per cent in 1981 to 42 per cent in
1991 and 44.6 per cent in 2001. As a result, the
workforce too has increased from 14.95 million
in 1981 to 18.89 million in 1991 (an increase of

The increase in the total
work participation rate
occurred largely because
of the increase in female
work participation.

However, the composition of women workers
across different economic activities reveals more
or less similar trends for both SCs, STs and all
groups. Out of total cultivators, the proportion
of women workers is about 30 per cent. SC
and ST women as a proportion of SC and ST
cultivators exhibit the same pattern. About 55
to 60 per cent of total agricultural labourers are
women, both for all groups and SCs/STs, and
among those engaged in household industries,
about 60 per cent are women. Women’s work
participation is high in activities relating to
agro-based manual work and household
industrial activities requiring low skills. The
proportion of SCs and STs in the total ‘other
workers’, which includes high-end jobs of the
tertiary sector and manufacturing sector, is 14.0
and 4.0 per cent respectively. The proportion of
women as a proportion of the total number of
SC and ST workers is about 28 per cent, which
is significantly higher than women workers
as a proportion of the total ‘other workers’
(22 per cent). SC and ST women’s participation
as a proportion of total SC and ST workers in
the ‘other workers category’ is also significantly
higher than the total women workers under this
category.

2.64 per cent per annum) and to 23.52 million
in 2001 (2.45 per cent per annum) (Table 4.15).
The increase in the total work participation rate
occurred largely because of the increase in female
work participation.

Work participation rates by social
groups
The 2001 census provides data on SC and ST
workers by broad category of activities. According
to available data, 16.85 per cent of the total
workers (main + marginal) are SCs and 7.27
per cent are STs. A category-wise comparison
shows that out of total cultivators, SCs constitute
nearly 12 per cent and STs 7.6 per cent. The
proportion of SC agricultural labourers is about 28
per cent and that of STs, about 12 per cent (Table
4.16). This indicates that SC and ST workers are
found predominantly in the agrarian sector where
they cluster in low-end jobs.
Women’s work participation rate
A comparison of work participation by women
(both general and among SCs and STs) shows
that participation among SC and ST women,
at about 41 per cent, is higher than women’s
work participation for all groups (35 per cent).

Given the trend of the movement of the workforce
towards the non-agricultural sector and the
monetisation of the economy, it is important
to examine the forms of employment and the
changes therein over time. Self-employment in
rural Karnataka declined from 55.93 per cent in
1983 to 50.20 per cent in 1999-2000. Regular
salaried jobs have increased in both rural and
urban Karnataka. The proportion of the rural
workforce employed as casual labour was not only
high at 38.8 per cent in 1983, but also increased
further, to 44.50 per cent by 1999-2000
(Table 4.17).
The proportion of marginal labour in the total
workforce is increasing steadily. The share of
marginal workers as a proportion of the total
workers in 1991 was 8.4 per cent, which
increased to 17.7 per cent in 2001. A decline
can be seen in the proportion of main workers
and a significant increase in the proportion of
marginal workers in all southern states and at
the all-India level (Table 4.18).
Over the years the average size of operational
holdings has been steadily declining, which
indirectly shows that net addition to the number of
marginal workers is increasing, particularly in the
farm sector. The quinquennial agricultural census
carried out by the Department of Economics
and Statistics shows that the average size of
operational holdings in Karnataka in 1970-71
was 3.20 ha., which has declined to 2.13 ha in
1991 and 1.74 ha in 2000-01. This casualisation

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

of labour reveals the increasing inability of the
market to provide full-time employment.

Organised and unorganised sector
employment
Organised sector employment, comprising public
and private sector employment, has registered
a negative rate of growth. Total organised sector
employment in Karnataka was 18.80 lakh in the
year 2000-01 and declined to 18.18 lakh by
the end of November 2004. There is no readily
available data on unorganised sector employment.
The 55th round NSS data for 1999-2000 provides
estimated employment for different sectors.
If one takes out the corresponding share of
organised sector employment from the aggregate
employment, one can arrive at an estimate of the
proportion of unorganised sector employment
in the state. Unorganised sector employment
contributes to nearly 92 per cent of aggregate
employment. The share of organised sector
employment is not only small, but also declining,
resulting in greater dependency on unorganised
sector employment. This unhealthy trend holds
true, not only for Karnataka, but for the all-India
level as well.

Sectoral growth of employment
In the context of the changes accompanying
the economic reform process, it is important
to examine the pattern of employment growth
across sectors in Karnataka. Two periods of time
will be considered, viz. (i) 1983 to 1993-94 and
(ii) 1993-94 to 1999-2000. In rural Karnataka,
the growth rate of employment in the agricultural
sector as well as trade decelerated during the
second period, and actually became negative for
mining and quarrying, manufacturing, utilities,
and community, social and personal services. The
only sectors wherein the growth rate accelerated
were transport, storage, communication, finance,
insurance and real estate. In sum, the rural
sector as a whole experienced little growth in
employment during the second period.
Urban Karnataka on the other hand, seems to
have sustained its employment growth during
the second period. The growth rates for the two
periods were 2.95 and 2.54 per cent respectively.

BOX 4.2

Changes in employment patterns over time: Karnataka versus
all-India






A decline in the extent of chronic unemployment (male and female; usual principal status)
in both rural and urban Karnataka; this is confirmed further by estimates adjusted for
subsidiary status employment. The experience was different at the all-India level: the
estimates (adjusted as well as unadjusted) based on the usual status criterion show some
increase in unemployment for male and female in rural all-India, as well as for male in
urban all-India, as against a decrease in female unemployment in urban all-India.
Intermittent unemployment, as indicated by estimates of current weekly status, show a
marginal increase for both male and female in rural Karnataka and a decline for both in
urban Karnataka. At the all-India level, intermittent unemployment increased for both
sexes in the rural sector, increased for males in the urban sector and decreased for females
in the urban sector.
Unemployment by current daily status decreased for rural males, registered a marginal
increase for rural females and declined for both in the urban areas of Karnataka. However,
unemployment by this criterion registered a perceptible increase for both males and
females in rural all-India and for males in urban all-India. At the all-India level, the urban
sector experienced a decline the in female unemployment rate.

Thus, in sum, Karnataka seems to have done relatively better than the rest of the country in
dealing with the unemployment situation during the 1990s.

Employment declined in agriculture, mining and
quarrying, utilities and community, social and
personal services, but registered an increase in
manufacturing, construction, trade, transport,
storage, communication, finance, insurance, real
estate and non-agricultural activities.

Sectoral composition of employment
Agriculture continues to be the major source of
employment in the rural sector. The proportion of
rural workers employed in agriculture (including
animal husbandry, forestry and logging and
fishing) declined from 84.40 per cent in 1983 to
81.90 per cent in 1993-94 and remained at about
the same level thereafter. However, with the urban
sector’s workforce dependence on agriculture
declining, a similar trend is evident in the state
overall. The manufacturing sector, as a source of
employment, has declined in importance in rural
Karnataka but has virtually remained static in
urban Karnataka. Consistent with this profile, the
proportion of Karnataka’s workforce engaged in
non-agriculture, especially in the urban sector,
has increased during the same period. For the
state as a whole, the proportion increased from
89

This broadly reveals that growth in employment
is mainly Bangalore-centric. Bangalore is
supporting a large number of Information
Technology based industries, which generate
high-end, skill-based employment. There
has been a significant increase in marginal
employment in Bangalore as well, mainly due
to construction activities. There is a large influx
of migrant unskilled labourers to Bangalore
resulting in the high growth of marginal workers.
Much of this migration has been triggered by low
growth and recurrent drought in the state. This
phenomenon of employment growth centering
only around Bangalore imposes great stress on
its infrastructure. In recent times the state has
initiated policies to develop growth centres in
other cities as well.

between 1991 and 2001, largely contributed
to by the growth in the number of marginal
workers. The number of main workers increased
at a rate of 12 per cent and marginal workers
by 161.5 per cent during this period. The
growth of employment is highest in Bangalore
Urban district (54.8 per cent), followed by
Dakshina Kannada (27.8 per cent), Dharwad
(27.6 per cent), Koppal (24.9 per cent) and
Mysore and Raichur with about 26 per cent
each. These are the districts where employment
growth is higher than the state average. Across
districts there is significant growth in Bangalore
Urban in terms of main and marginal workers,
whereas the districts of Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga
and Raichur have a negative rate of growth for
main workers. All these districts are located in
north Karnataka.

The extent of unemployment will be examined
from different perspectives, viz. (i) usual status;
(ii) current weekly status; and (iii) current daily
status. Estimates of unemployment in Karnataka
corresponding to these three perspectives
are presented separately for male and
female, by sector, for the years 1993-94 and
1999-2000 in Table 4.20. The estimate by the
usual status criterion provides a measure of
chronic unemployment; this estimate adjusted
for (excluding) workers on subsidiary status is

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

called ‘Usual Status Adjusted’. Estimates by
the current weekly status measures current
unemployment (chronic as well as temporary);
and current daily status encompasses chronic
unemployment, temporary unemployment and
under-employment. In other words, among
these measures, the current daily status
estimate would be the most comprehensive
measure. It is an estimate of the average level
of unemployment on a day during the survey
year. It is a comprehensive estimate since it is
based on the unemployed days of the chronically
unemployed, the unemployment days of those
who are usually employed but unemployed
intermittently and the unemployed days of those
who are employed as per the current weekly
status approach. Thus, it takes into account the
unemployed days of even employed persons,
and hence, seasonal unemployment also. The
estimates for the rural and urban areas of
Karnataka and all-India show diverse patterns
of change (Table 4.20).

The Table 4.21 indicates that there was a decline
in the extent of unemployment (male and female)
in both rural and urban Karnataka as against
an increase (male and female) in rural all-India,
(male) in urban all-India and a decrease only
in female unemployment in urban all-India. The
conclusion is that Karnataka seems to have fared
better than India as a whole in dealing with the
unemployment situation.

Policy responses
The Government of Karnataka has explored
many policy options to reduce the deprivation
levels of the population. The policies include
programmes to promote growth and
redistribution. Broadly, the redistributive
strategy seeks to reduce poverty by means of
the following interventions:

Promote asset endowment of the poor by
programmes such as land reforms and
Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana
(SGSY);

Offer direct employment opportunities
through programmes like the Sampoorna
Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) and
Stree Shakti; and

Programmes for employment generation are
of two types: (i) the set of schemes falling
under Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana
(SGRY) to provide wage employment; and (ii)
those promoting self-employment of the rural
poor falling under three broad schemes called
Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY),
Stree Shakti and Swavalambana. Some salient
features and achievements of these programmes
in recent years are as follows:



Promote food security through the public
distribution system and subsidised food
grains.

These measures have achieved some success
as reflected in the reduction in the estimates
of poverty over time. However, the reduction in
poverty has not been uniform across districts.
The percentage point reduction in the incidence of
poverty between 1993-94 and 1999-2000 was
much less in northern Karnataka than in the south
and the average for the state (Suryanarayana and
Zaidi, 2002).
One major policy emphasis in recent years has
been on growth in the rural areas by measures
to promote (i) productivity in agriculture and

Various government programmes, including
direct wage employment programmes, such
as Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana,
Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana, departmental
works in irrigation, roads, buildings, command
area development etc. generate considerable
wage employment, which support the
employment needs of the rural sector. The
details of wage employment generated from
1999-2000 to 2004-05 may be seen in
Table 4.24.

Concerns












Comparable with all-India trends, Karnataka
is experiencing a structural change in the
composition of its State Domestic Product
with the share of the primary sector declining
in favour of the tertiary sector and the
intermediary secondary sector remaining
almost constant. Employment, however, is
still primary sector oriented, with secondary
and tertiary sectors contributing relatively
lower proportions. Though the economy has
grown at a moderate compound growth rate
of around 6 per cent during the decade, the
growth of the primary sector has increased
only marginally, (by less than one per cent)
and it is the secondary and tertiary sectors
that have fuelled this growth in the state.
Another area of concern is the low
participation of women in the secondary and
tertiary sectors. Women are found largely
in unskilled low-end jobs like agriculture
labour, household industries etc. Women
constitute nearly 60 per cent of agricultural
labourers. There is a disparity in the relative
agricultural wages between men and women
besides disparity in real and nominal wages.
This further pushes women into a poverty
trap.
Karnataka has the second largest percentage
of children living in poor households, rural
and urban, among the four southern states.
While government has initiated many
programmes for child labour, the results
are mixed because the policy focuses on
rehabilitation rather than prevention.
Existing child labour laws do not cover the
so-called non-hazardous sectors such as
agriculture, domestic and home-based work,
and the informal sector, where more than 90
per cent of children work. There is, thus, a
contradiction between the law on compulsory
education which bans all work during school
hours and the child labour law.There are also
contradictions between these two laws on
the magnitude of punishments for employers
of children.
Another area of concern is negative growth
in organised sector employment in recent
years. While the share of the organised sector





in the aggregate employment is very low at
eight per cent, a proportion comparable with
all-India, it will further decline to lower levels
if remedial policy measures are not taken
with appropriate state interventions.
Poverty trends show a declining trend in the
state, comparable with the all-India trend.
However, urban poverty in Karnataka is
higher than the rural poverty levels. One of
the apparent reasons for the high incidence
of urban poverty is migration from the rural
to urban areas for employment.
The large number of agricultural labourers
as a proportion of the total work force
adversely impacts labour productivity,
per capita income and poverty levels due
to an excessive dependence on agriculture.
Inter-district comparisons show that leading
districts such as Bangalore, Kodagu, and
Dakshina Kannada have a low proportion
of agricultural labourers in the aggregate
employment. These districts have high
labour productivity and per capita income,
and a low incidence of poverty. Backward
districts like Raichur, Gulbarga and Haveri
have a high proportion of agricultural
labour but relatively low productivity levels,
per capita income and a high incidence of
poverty.

Recommendations




Formulate a comprehensive employment
strategy aiming at sectoral and regional
diversification; identify appropriate labour
intensive technologies; encourage faster
growth in the primary sector; reduce regional
disparities.
Reorient the employment strategy to absorb
the growing labour force by creating more job
opportunities and a growth strategy focusing
on the primary sector, which can sustain and
absorb the increasing employment needs.
The growth strategy must also focus on
creating employment opportunities in the
non-farm and household industry sectors
which are highly labour intensive.The tertiary
sector though contributing significantly to the
state income, is not labour intensive and is
confined to highly skilled jobs.There is a large

There is a disparity in the
relative agricultural wages
between men and women
besides disparity in real
and nominal wages. This
pushes women into a
poverty trap.

chunk of the educated unemployed without
any technical skills, who need to be provided
with training for productive employment. The
state must devise a policy aimed at absorbing
such segments of the labour force through
appropriate training.
Strengthen policies to empower women
to emerge from the poverty syndrome
and to also increase access to better
economic resources by encouraging them
to participate in skill-based productive
economic activities.
Counter and reverse the process of
marginalisation
of
labour
through
self- employment and regular employment.
Manage rural out-migration with a suitable
region specific employment policy to create
more sustainable job opportunities in rural
areas.










Promote non-farm income generating
activities to generate more productive
employment opportunities in the non-farm
sector.
The ongoing efforts of the state government
in setting up self-help groups like Stree Shakti
will have to be intensified.
Attack the problem of child labour on several
fronts: reduction of household poverty,
universal enrolment and retention in school,
and strengthening legal provisions and
enforcement.
Amend labour legislation to cover children in
non-hazardous sectors.
The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act
of 1976 should be amended so as to identify
and punish those who are practising child
bonded labour.
