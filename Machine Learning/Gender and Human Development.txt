Gender and Human Development

Gender and Human Development
Introduction
The 1999 Karnataka Human Development
Report provided a range of data and analysis
documenting widespread discrimination against
girls and women in economic, political as well
as social life. It pointed out that public policies
to change this situation had not been completely
effective because women had been viewed
primarily as homemakers, rather than as full and
equal citizens in a just society.
This chapter examines the extent to which there
has been a change in perspective in the intervening
years between the first and second Reports.
Has a new and more unified vision emerged,
that acknowledges women as empowered and
autonomous agents of social and human progress?
To what extent have the government’s policies
and programmes drawn from such a vision? How
effective have they been in empowering women
and transforming gender relations? How has
women’s position in the economy and in politics
changed? What insights does our analysis provide
for the steps to be taken from here on?

may not always be matched by a correspondingly
high GDI ranking. However, low performance
on gender indicators almost always goes
hand-in-hand with poor human development
indicators overall. Unequal gender relations,
exacerbated by disparities of income and caste, can
contribute significantly to a lowering of the overall
HDI, simply because women constitute almost half
the population. Systemic gender biases mean that,
where human development is poor, the burdens fall
disproportionately on women. When government
and other programmes for improving schooling,
nutrition, health or a range of other services such
as safe drinking water, sanitation, housing, do not
reach people effectively, this lack of reach affects
women and girls most adversely. Latent gender
biases within families, communities and service
providers themselves mean that women, who are
most in need of public services, are often excluded
from their purview. In Karnataka, as in many
states, gender disparities are also linked to regional
disparities in human development.
BOX 8.1

In looking at human development from a gendered
perspective, three questions will be addressed
initially: (i) In what ways is human development
linked to gender discrimination in particular? (ii) Is
poverty congruent with poor human development
for women? (iii) How do we understand the
concept of ‘empowerment’?

What is gender analysis?

Gender as a lens for human
development

Gender analysis is a process that assesses the differential impact of proposed and/or existing
policies, programmes and legislation on women and men. It makes it possible for policy to
be undertaken with an appreciation of gender differences, of the nature of relationships
between women and men and of their different social realities, life expectations and economic
circumstances. It is a tool for understanding social processes and for responding with informed
and equitable options.

The place of gender analysis in policies and
programmes that are intended to balance the
pressures for economic growth with the needs of
human development has been recognised, almost
from the inception of the U.N. Human Development
Reports. The development of specific indices such
as the gender development index (GDI) and the
gender empowerment measure (GEM) mark this
recognition. It is well known that a high HDI ranking

‘Sex’ identifies the biological differences between women and men. ‘Gender’ is the culturally
specific set of characteristics that identifies the social behaviour of women and men and the
relationship between them. Gender, therefore, refers not simply to women or men, but to the
relationship between them, and the way it is socially constructed. Because it is a relational term,
gender must include women and men. Like the concepts of class, race and ethnicity, gender is an
analytical tool for understanding social processes.

It compares how and why women and men are affected by policy issues. Gender analysis
challenges the assumption that everyone is affected by policies, programmes and legislation in
the same way regardless of gender, a notion often referred to as ‘gender-neutral policy’.

Gender and Human Development

Despite the strong
correlation between poor
human development
indicators and gender
disparity, there are
other kinds of gender
discrimination, which,
perversely, are worse in
places where traditional
human development
indicators are good.
Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the
aversion to daughters,
known otherwise as ‘son
preference’.

Table 8.1 reveals the sharp distinctions among the
districts and the regions of the state overall. While
the districts of south Karnataka are generally at
the top of the composite index (with the exception
of Davangere), followed by the districts of Bombay
Karnataka, the districts of Hyderabad Karnataka
are near the bottom of the composite index.These
district-and region-wise indicators are forerunners
of a scenario that is played out along a range of
other dimensions having to do with work and
income as well.1

Is gender congruent with poverty?
Despite the strong correlation between poor human
development indicators and gender disparity,
there are other kinds of gender discrimination,
which, perversely, are worse in places where
traditional human development indicators are
good. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the
aversion to daughters, known otherwise as ‘son
preference’. The intensity of such forms of gender
discrimination, as evidenced by worsening sex
ratios, oddly enough, is not correlated with poor
human development indicators. Violence against
women is not always associated with regions of low
economic growth and poor human development
indicators. These phenomena suggest that gender
violence is assuming new forms as the economy
grows. An improvement in human development,
which does not always mean a commensurate
improvement in all forms of gender equity, can
scarcely be regarded as a process that truly
enlarges people’s choices.

Empowerment
‘Empowerment’ has emerged as a key concept in
policy discussions on gender over the last decade
and a half. The concept, in recent times, has
become so elastic that it has lost the dimensions,

1
An important caveat at the start of this discussion is the major
changes in the delineation of district boundaries. In 1989,
Bangalore Rural district was split from Bangalore. In 1997,
Bagalkot district was split from Bijapur, Chamarajnagar district
from Mysore, Gadag district from Dharwad, Haveri district from
Dharwad, Koppal district from Raichur, Udupi district from
Dakshina Kannada; and Davangere district was created from
parts of Bellary, Chitradurga and Shimoga. This carving out of
new districts has meant that our analysis of changes over time
has been limited to using those sources that provide comparable
district-wise figures.

which originally gave it strength and shape.
Empowerment, conceptually, has certain key
components: (i) it radically shifted from the old
top–down ‘welfare’ approach of treating women
as a disadvantaged group in need of handouts,
towards a recognition of the structural roots of
gender bias; (ii) it addressed the issue of power
and powerlessness that goes with gender and
other forms of inequality; (iii) most significant is
the recognition that a change in power relations
requires not only a change in control over external
resources such as land and income but also a
change in the person’s sense of self-worth and
confidence; (iv) it emphasised the importance of
group processes and solidarity as a way of breaking
the cycle of hopelessness and helplessness that
unequal gender relations perpetuate.
As has happened with many other concepts,
‘empowerment’ has been so overused and
misused that it has lost its core meaning. One
often finds a programme being described as a
programme for women’s empowerment without
any clarity as to how it will actually change
existing power relations. Rescuing the concept of
empowerment so that it can have more analytical
content for policies requires us to examine
whether there has, in actual fact, been a change in
mindsets, i.e. a paradigm shift away from the old
‘welfare’ approach and whether there has been a
corresponding change in policies and institutions
supported by a key ingredient of systemic change,
namely investment or is it ‘business as usual’, with
some tinkering? Some of these issues (financing
and gender audit) are addressed in chapter 3,
Part III.

Human development: Gender
dimensions and differentials
For any patriarchal society to move towards
greater gender equality, as part of a process of
human development, requires change at many
levels – in values and norms, in structures and
institutions, and in behaviour and practices. This
can happen if women are empowered in economic,
political and socio-cultural terms. They need more
access to resources, greater political voice and
social transformations that lead to their exercising
greater agency and autonomy in the decisions

BOX 8.2

What is empowerment?
The question is both complex and complicated. Women members of self-help groups financed
under two government programmes gave a variety of answers to this question.They offer several
definitions all of which may justifiably be described as facets of a process of empowerment. In
the context of the SHG programme, and in the larger context of poverty, women put the ability
to improve their economic status on top followed by an improvement in their status in their
families in terms of both greater respect and, more concretely, enhanced participation in family
decision-making. If gender justice comes low on the priority list then clearly the programme
must do more by way of conscientisation.

that affect their own lives and society in general.
However, focusing on women alone cannot make
such changes happen. Such transformations in
consciousness take time and require open public
debate and discussion, and efforts through the
educational system, and through communications
and the media. Men must change their entrenched
patriarchal discourse in favour of one that is
inclusive and gender-friendly.
The role of the state lies in preventing harm and
protecting girls and women on the one hand,
and promoting women’s empowerment, gender
equality and male transformation on the other. In
order to play this role effectively, the state must
do at least four things: support changes in social
norms and practices; promote key legal/political
changes; create strong institutions at multiple
levels from the village to the highest levels; and
provide resources and make investments. How the
state brings about changes in gender relations,
and with what strategic vision during a period of
significant socio-economic change brought on by
economic liberalisation, will provide the touchstone
for whether any real movement towards gender
equality will occur in the coming decade.

The following sections analyse some of the
macro-trends in the available data on key elements
of gender dimensions and differentials in order to
explicate critical changes in the environment for
state action. Of the three elements that constitute
the Human Development Index, education and
healthcare and the ways they impact gender are
explored in chapters 5 and 6 respectively, hence,
this chapter will analyse the third component,
work and income. To this, two additional sets of
indicators have been added – the sex ratio, and
women’s autonomy. The focus is on highlighting
differentials wherever possible, in order to point
to the varying life experiences of women and
men, and the skewed life chances that young girls
face.

Work participation and worker
distribution: Feminisation of poverty
Work participation provides key insights into the
core issues of women’s economic dependence and
their ability to control incomes and expenditures,
exercise some degree of personal autonomy and
share in decision-making.
While examining the work participation data from
1991 to 2001 it must be borne in mind that the
1990s were a period of significant growth in new
industries in Karnataka, fuelled by, but not limited
to, the boom in the information technology sector.
The assumption is that work participation, the
share of workers who are main workers, and the
number, which is not dependent on agriculture,
would increase during the period.
Table 8.2 shows that except Kerala, the work
participation rates (WPR) for both men and
women in Karnataka were similar to the other
southern states in 2001. There was only a small
increase (2.5 percentage points) over 1991 in
WPR for women and men.
Table 8.3 reveals that WPR for men increased
by 4.7 per cent while for women it went up by
8.8 per cent. This increase in WPR was not evenly
distributed. Barring Davangere and Chikmaglur
that showed negative rates of change for women,
the remaining districts of south Karnataka saw
significant increases in female WPR.

Male-female differences in WPR continued
with only a marginal change in the differential.
What is interesting is that the male WPRs are
less widely dispersed across the districts than
the corresponding female rates. For example,
Bombay Karnataka, with an average increase
for women of 6.4 per cent, included both
-10.7 per cent for Bijapur and +14.4 per cent
for Dharwad. It is clear that the rates of change
in WPR for women are much more widely
dispersed across the districts and regions. This
probably points to greater volatility in both
the demand and supply of female labour, as
also their marginal character. If women’s work
participation is more marginal, then the rates are
likely to be more variable over time and across
space as well.
Turning to the distribution between main and
marginal workers,Table 8.4 shows that Karnataka
in 2001 had the highest percentage of marginal
workers among women (34.12 per cent), and the
lowest percentage of marginal workers among
men (8.79 per cent) in the four southern states.
Between 1991 and 2001, the share of main
workers has declined for both men and women
and while the share of marginal workers has
gone up for men (by 7.75 percentage points);
the increase is even more significant for women
(11.47 percentage points).

However, while the percentage for men is still
under 10 per cent of the total, the percentage for
women has increased from less than one-fourth
to over one-third. The percentage point increases
are also much higher for women. Most striking
is the fact that in the districts of Hyderabad
Karnataka, the share of marginal workers among
women went from 14 per cent to an astonishing
39 per cent. Bombay Karnataka districts also saw
a significant increase in the proportion of marginal
workers among women.
Analysing the data on work participation along
with the findings on main versus marginal
workers presents a disturbing picture of the
geographical context of female poverty. Work
participation rates either fell or were stagnant
in the Hyderabad Karnataka region and saw
modest increases in the Bombay Karnataka
region. The share of marginal workers (male
and female) has also shown the most dramatic
increase in Hyderabad Karnataka, followed by
Bombay Karnataka. And the outcomes of this
development are much worse for women. An
examination of the data on the distribution of
workers by category further substantiates this
downward trend for women and work.

Between 1991 and 2001,
the share of main workers
has declined for both men
and women and while the
share of marginal workers
has gone up for men (by
7.75 percentage points);
the increase is even more
significant for women
(11.47 percentage points).

household industry and other workers in
Karnataka is nearer the all-India average than the
other southern states. However, a closer analysis
of the data on the distribution of workers by
category reveals even more disturbing trends for
women’s work. Between 1991 and 2001, while
male dependence on agricultural work, either as
cultivators or as labourers, declined sharply from
58 to 49 per cent, their share of the category ‘other
workers’ which includes work in industry and the
service sectors went up from 40 to 48 per cent.
The scenario has been reversed for women. True,
their presence in the agriculture sector is much
more visible: the percentage of women cultivators
went up by 4.82 per cent but, unfortunately,
the percentage of women agricultural labourers
also showed an upward trend by 5.02 per cent.
Women’s share in the category ‘other workers’
fell precipitously by 14.9 per cent. However,
their share in household industry registered an
increase.
The district and region-wise picture for the
distribution of workers across categories is
presented in Table 8.6. Female dependence on
agriculture is higher than male, across all districts
and it is particularly high in north Karnataka.
The maximum number of female household
industry workers is found in two districts,
Dakshina Kannada (46.15 per cent) and Udupi
(26.12 per cent) primarily due to beedi and
agarbathi that are home-based activities.
Although the percentage of female ‘other workers’
is only half of the male work force, Bangalore
Urban district has a fairly equitable distribution of
male and female workers followed by Kodagu.The
percentage of female ‘other workers’ is the highest
in Haveri (46.16 per cent) in north Karnataka.
Overall, the decade has not been favourable to poor
women.The trends point, instead, to a feminisation
of poverty which is an all-India phenomenon
and not unique to Karnataka. The increasing
casualisation of female labour represented by
the increase in the number of women marginal
workers suggests that the economy is unable to
generate full time employment for women. Their
increasing dependence on agriculture and, more
specifically, on agricultural labour, coupled with

a declining presence in the category of ‘other
workers’ is directly related to a reverse trend in
the male work force. It could mean that men are
migrating from the rural sector due to various
factors or that the informal sector has grown
faster than the agricultural sector. It could have
been an opportunity for women, but the sad
reality is that women get jobs traditionally held

by men only when men leave those jobs, because
they have ceased to be remunerative. And once
jobs held by women become remunerative, then
men take over. Overall, the fruits of the state’s
economic boom of the 1990s do not appear to
have trickled down to the northern districts and
it has not benefited women workers, especially
those from the poorer regions. The last piece of

corroborating evidence regarding the feminisation
of poverty is from the data on differentials and
trends in agricultural wages.

In both absolute and
relative terms, the
female-male wage
gap went up sharply,
providing one more
reason to conclude that
female workers have
fared worse than their
male counterparts during
the decade.

As public healthcare
for women and girls
improved, the female
sex ratio also registered
a modest improvement.
Unfortunately, a new
and ugly form of sex
discrimination has now
become visible – one that
is strongly correlated with
prosperity and daughter
aversion.

180

As in the rest of the country, male wages are higher
than female wages. This is one manifestation of
gender discrimination that refuses to disappear,
arising as it does, from an inequitable gender
division of labour. Agricultural wages also show
the same range – a fact that has significant
implications, considering that agricultural labourers
are, typically, among the poorest and have high
proportions of Dalit and tribal population. Table
8.7 shows that the absolute difference between
male and female wages increased from Rs.4.57
in 1991 to Rs.18.92 in 2001. As a percentage
of the female agricultural wage rate, the gap
went up from 33.75 per cent to 53.83 per cent.
In both absolute and relative terms, the
female–male wage gap went up sharply, providing
one more reason to conclude that female workers
have fared worse than their male counterparts
during the decade. The difference was particularly
stark in Bidar, Gulbarga and Koppal districts
with male agricultural wages being more than
double the female wage. Districts with the least
differences in male-female wages are Haveri,
Gadag and Shimoga.

Sex ratio
The sex ratio in Karnataka started in 1901 as the
lowest among the southern states, and the gap
has increased by 2001, in relation to both Kerala
and Andhra Pradesh, although not Tamil Nadu
(Table 8.8). Between 1991 and 2001, the ratio
improved marginally in all four states. However,
the southern states have performed well overall.
Haryana has the lowest sex ratio (861) in the
country and Kerala the highest (1,058). There
were only four districts in the state in which the
sex ratio improved over the course of the century
(Table 8.9). Ten districts are below the state norm
and of these, Bangalore Urban district, which ranks
first in the district HDI, has the dubious distinction
of coming last with a female sex ratio of 906,
comparable to Nagaland (909). Udupi (1,127),
Dakshina Kannada (1,023) and Hassan (1,005)
compare favourably with Kerala, although Udupi,
unfortunately, has regressed from 1,134 in 1991.

In the four districts (Shimoga, Uttara Kannada,
Chikmaglur and Kodagu) where the sex ratio
improved over the course of the century, the ratio
was still significantly below average at the start
of the century. The bulk of the decline for most
districts occurred in the period between 1901 and
1981, i.e. prior to the period when sex selection
began to be practised in a significant way.
These declines in the female sex ratio undoubtedly
were caused by poor reproductive healthcare and
gender biases, which ensured that women and
girls did not have access to adequate nutrition and
healthcare. Hence, as public healthcare for women
and girls improved, the female sex ratio also
registered a modest improvement. Unfortunately,
a new and ugly form of sex discrimination has now
become visible – one that is strongly correlated
with prosperity and daughter aversion.

Child sex ratio
The child sex ratio (CSR) signals the onset of a
scary scenario where women could vanish and
society would have just one gender. At the
all-India level, the CSR in 1991 was 945 and
regressed to 927 in 2001. The sharpest decline
was noticed in the economically developed
states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat,
Uttaranchal, Punjab, Maharashtra and the Union
Territory of Chandigarh. All three southern
states other than Kerala also experienced
a significant decline (Table 8.10), although
lower than the all-India figure. This alarming
trend has its roots in the Indian aversion to
daughters and preference for sons, a notion
that has strong economic and cultural roots. A
son is viewed as an economic asset whereas a
daughter is insensitively perceived as a drain
on the family’s resources. When this perception
interconnects with the low status that society
and culture traditionally accord women, then
some sections of society conclude that modern
technology, through pre-birth sex selection and
female foeticide, offers the ‘perfect’ solution to
reducing the female population. An overview of
region-wise and district-wise differences
is presented in Table 8.11. The Hyderabad
Karnataka and Bombay Karnataka regions, to a
lesser extent, experienced smaller improvements

in the overall sex ratio between 1991 and 2001
than south Karnataka. However, the extent
of the decline in the child sex ratio (with the
exception of Belgaum and Gulbarga districts)
is also lower in the two poorer regions than in
south Karnataka. The district with the highest
decline in CSR is Mandya, which is a relatively
high-income district. Here, unwillingness to
fragment property through either inheritance or
dowry has led to a desire for one or two children,
preferably only sons. It is unfortunate that
Dakshina Kannada has also registered a decline
in CSR. Some districts show an improvement
and, except Kodagu, these districts do not have
high levels of literacy or economic development.
Hence, high education levels do not necessarily
translate into gender sensitivity. High incomes
mean that people have access to, and can afford
to pay for, the technology for sex selection. The
skewed child sex ratio is a manifestation of a
covert form of gender violence with enormous
social implications. As regions experience
economic growth and poverty reduction, as long
as gender bias persists and is reflected in the
spread and increase of dowry and other practices,
the possibility of more people undertaking sex
selection also increases. Without systematic
efforts to address this problem, increases
in economic growth, consumerism, and
improvements in health and education may
well translate into stronger daughter aversion.
The stakeholders are many: parents, husbands,
doctors, nurses, and the manufacturers of
equipment used for sex selection who aggressively
market the latest technology. Women also opt
for sex selection for a variety of reasons such

as domestic violence, harassment and lack of
awareness. Enforcement of laws prohibiting
the use of technology for sex selection and
awareness building by government, NGOs and
activist groups can reduce the growth of this
heinous practice.
With the exception of only 8 out of 27 districts,
the child sex ratio is worse in urban than in rural
areas (Table 8.12).

Women’s autonomy
Along three dimensions, household decisions,
freedom of movement, and access to money,
the picture for women in Karnataka relative to
the rest of India is mixed. Women in Karnataka
have greater physical mobility and access to
money, but less say in decisions about their
own healthcare and other household decisions
(Table 8.13).

Violence against women
The UN Declaration on the Elimination of
Violence against Women (1993) defines ‘violence
against women’ as any act of gender-based
violence that results in, or is likely to result in
physical, sexual or mental harm and suffering
to women whether occurring in public or private
life. This definition encapsulates a wide range
of offences ranging from dowry deaths, spousal
abuse, rape, trafficking in women, sexual
harassment, sex selection etc. Bringing ‘domestic’
violence within the domain of violence against
women means that what was traditionally
hidden as a ‘family’ or ‘personal’ matter such as
wife battering or dowry-related harassment is

now an offence on par with violence perpetrated
against women in the public domain. Violence
against women has its roots in men’s economic
and social domination and their control of
female sexuality and reproduction. It is also
an instrument in the domination and control of
the poor by upper castes. Human development
cannot occur in an environment that is vitiated
by violence. Women, who are caught up in an
environment of violence, or even the threat of

violence, find it constrains their mobility, their

The incidence of physical abuse of women in
Karnataka is 21.5 per cent, which is slightly higher
than the all-India average. Women in the southern
states, except Kerala, receive the same degree of
mistreatment as their sisters in the rest of the
country. However, women in Karnataka receive
less physical mistreatment than their counterparts

in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh – if this can
count as a positive trend (Table 8.14).
Data on crimes against women (Table 8.15)
indicates there is little correlation between the
number of registered crimes in police records
and the widespread nature of violence against
women across social institutions. The fact that
crimes against women are under-represented in
official records points to the difficulties women
experience in reporting crimes and the resistance
of public authorities to taking legal cognisance of
offences against women. However, one category
of crimes i.e. a category of deaths exclusively of
women – mainly young, newly married women

– has emerged in the public consciousness due to
the efforts of women’s groups and NGOs. In police
records, they are classified under three specific
categories, which invoke different sections of the
law. These are ‘dowry murders’ (committed by the
woman's husband or members of his family for
additional dowry or non-payment of promised
dowry); ‘suicides’ (forced or voluntary, but in most
cases related to dowry demands); and ‘accidents’
(a majority classified under ‘stove burst’ or ‘kitchen
accident’). Deaths under these three categories
add up to an alarming figure (Vimochana, 1999).
Also, in the early phase of the study, as it collated
police statistics,Vimochana, an NGO, noted a major
anomaly between its figures and those of the police.

The fact that crimes
against women are
under-represented in

It found that a large number of deaths were being
classified in police records as ‘accidents’ under ‘UDR’
(Unnatural Death Register). The category of ‘dowry
deaths’ in a technical sense only included those
cases that had been booked by the police under
the relevant sections of the law.The ‘accident’ cases
that were closed for want of evidence, however,
were largely due to ‘stove bursts’ or ‘kitchen
accidents’. Investigations revealed that a large
number of murders and suicides, punishable under
law, were being made to look like ‘accidents’ by the
husband and/or members of his family.These cases
were closed by the investigating police officers for
want of hard evidence of a crime. In Bangalore city
alone, 1,133 women died in murders, suicides and
accidents in 1997, 1,248 in 1998, and 618 till
mid-July 1999 (Menon, 1999).

If official figures on dowry-related crimes, including
murder and attempt to murder (under Sections
302, 307 and 304-B IPC) are added to figures
on cruelty by husband and relatives of husband
(Section 498-A IPC), (Table 8.15), it is more than
evident that for large numbers of married women,
the right to live in safety, even within their own
homes (ironically, the one place an individual
expects to feel secure), and in a climate free from
intimidation and violence, is not available. Thirty
per cent of all crimes against women in 2003
were registered under these sections. Another 29

The stagnation in women’s work participation
in the poorer districts, the narrowing of their
work and income opportunities, growing wage
differentials between men and women and the
huge and apparently increasing disparities among
the higher and lower income regions of the state,
when combined with rising aspirations as reflected
in women’s growing educational involvement,
pose a major challenge to the policies, strategies
and programmes of the government.
During the last decade, state actions to support
women have occurred, both through and
outside the Department of Women and Child

186

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

Development (DWCD). Major strategies outside
DWCD include the allotment and provision
of housing title deeds (hakku patras) for
women only under government sponsored, low
income-housing programmes and a 30 per cent
job reservation for women in all direct recruitments
by the government and PSUs after 1996. Over
8,00,000 women are now sole home-owners
under the government financed Ashraya and
Ambedkar housing programmes. In a patriarchal
society, few women own or inherit assets such as
land and houses, hence the government’s policy,
which has enabled a large class of poor women to
become homeowners, is truly remarkable. About 50
per cent are Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
women. With reference to recruitment, out of the
45,018 sanctioned posts in 85 departments and
72 Boards and Corporations, 13,204 posts have
been reserved for women and the quota has been
slightly over-fulfilled, which is commendable.
In the next section, we will look at policy
approaches to strengthening women’s economic
capabilities and political participation, as well as
addressing violence against women.

Enabling economic development
Four broad features distinguish the approach
taken by the state government during the last
decade or so to strengthen women’s access to
income and economic resources. These include
(i) a strong emphasis on the self-help group
(SHG) model; (ii) a clear focus on poor, Dalit and
tribal women as those most in need, along with
women with disabilities or victims of violence;
(iii) a recognition that women in the districts of
Hyderabad Karnataka and Bombay Karnataka
need special attention; and (iv) the use of the
language of empowerment.

Gender and Human Development

It is undeniable that
schemes that attack
poverty, through credit
to women, augment the
income of the household,
impacting household
consumption directly.
But how far do these
interventions go in
altering intra-household
power dynamics – roles,
dependencies, and
authority?

and (iv) women from families with alcoholics, drug
addicts or physically disabled persons. As of March
2004, DWCD has formed 1,00,000 groups with a
total of 14,79,794 members, of whom 3,10,358 are
Scheduled Castes, 1,18,359 are Scheduled Tribes,
and 99,779 are from the minority communities.
The DWCD is also responsible for Swayam Sidha, a
centrally sponsored scheme (formerly Indira Mahila
Yojana) to form SHGs through the facilitation of the
anganwadi workers. The Karnataka State Women’s
Development Corporation (KSWDC) promotes
income generation, giving priority to single women
and households eligible for Swarna Jayanthi Shahari
Rozgar Yojana loans. KSWDC provides support by
identifying entrepreneurs, providing technical help to
identify viable projects, facilitating credit, promoting
marketing, training, and strengthening women’s
cooperatives.The KSWDC is responsible for different
state sponsored schemes such as Udyogini (for
credit to women entrepreneurs), the urban
Stree Shakti scheme, and a devadasi rehabilitation
programme (economic and social programmes in
nine northern districts). In addition, KSWDC has
also run the World Bank-IFAD sponsored Swashakti
scheme to form SHGs through NGOs in 7 districts
– Kolar, Tumkur, Chitradurga, Bellary, Koppal,
Raichur and Gulbarga. Thirty-six NGOs have been
contracted to work in 979 project villages, and
have formed 2,100 SHGs with 38,508 members.
Almost 50 per cent of these women are illiterate,
60 per cent are landless or have less than one acre,
and about 59 per cent are SC/STs.
It is clear that the current approaches seek to link
gender with poverty, using development delivery
as a platform for targeting women as beneficiaries
and mobilising them for social empowerment.
Swashakti, for instance, conceives of the self-help
group strategy as a means to build women’s ‘self
reliance and self confidence, to provide greater
access to and control over resources, sensitise
and strengthen the institutional capacity of
support agencies to proactively address women’s
needs, increase incomes of poor women through
involvement in income-generating activities,
develop linkages between SHGs and lending
institutions to ensure access to credit financing,
and improve access to better healthcare,
education and drudgery reduction facilities. ’ This

188

is also true for micro-enterprise-oriented schemes
like Mane Belaku and Udyogini. Similarly, a
regional emphasis is discernible in programmes
like Swashakti that unequivocally target
backward districts. An explicit strategy underlying
programme delivery is the promotion of linkages.
Stree Shakti has established convergence with the
SGSY of the Rural Development and Panchayat
Raj department, the National Backward Class
Development Corporation, the department of
Animal Husbandry, and the Ashraya and Ambedkar
housing schemes. (For an analysis of Stree Shakti
and Swashakti groups, see Box 8.5).
It is undeniable that schemes that attack poverty,
through credit to women, augment the income of
the household, impacting household consumption
directly. But how far do these interventions go in
altering intra-household power dynamics – roles,
dependencies, and authority? The evaluation of
Udyogini and Mane Belaku throws up interesting
insights. The income from the activity pursued
from the Mane Belaku loan has been spent on food
expenses of the household in 70 per cent of cases,
implying the direct relevance of these to household
consumption. But the loan and subsidy have not
always contributed to supporting or building the
entrepreneurial potential of women. In many cases,
the money is channelled to an existing enterprise
run by the men of the household. While this may
bode well for the woman’s value to the household,
it falls short of the goal of women’s economic
empowerment. The survey (DES: 2004B) of
Stree Shakti and Swashakti groups however
reveals that about 45 per cent of the loans were
taken for economic activities and the remaining for
house construction, festivals/functions, healthcare
and children’s education.
In other instances, the mobilisation of women
into SHGs for micro-credit has also led to their
social empowerment. Stree Shakti groups as also
other SHGs have demonstrated their capacities
to use women’s agency in tackling gender
issues by protesting against arrack, gutka, child
marriage and other social issues. The domain
of the home however, remains an impregnable
bastion and poor women who may acquire an
ability to contest gender issues in the public

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

domain may still be unable to take up issues
of domestic violence. Studies have documented
how sangha women from Mahila Samakhya (a
GoI programme) sometimes endure violence
because they participate in sangha activities
(Krishnamurthy and Dave 2000). However, this
in itself must not be construed as a measure of
failure of an empowerment approach; rather, it
connotes the ways in which relations of power
are sought to be renegotiated, and the tradeoffs
involved in doing so. In another context, the
majority of the women surveyed in the DES
2004 survey said they did not meet with
resistance from either the spouse or family when
they participated in group meetings, visited the
bank or attended training. About one-fourth
actually saw a significant reduction in familybased violence after they joined the SHG.
Additionally, building the capacities of poor
women to understand markets, mobilising
them into groups, federating these groups so
women can more effectively deal with other
actors in the market, creation of new innovative
financial instruments, and provision of marketing
infrastructure are the most important components
needed to facilitate access to markets of the poor
and of women (Purushothaman, M.S. Subhas and
Nagrecha, 2004).

Addressing violence against women
Studies by the National Law School of India
(Centre for Women and Law, National Law
School of India University, 1999) and Hengasara
Hakkina Sangha (HHS), an NGO in Karnataka,
(Rao et al., 1999) point to the weakness of the
formal justice system in redressing violence
against women. NGOs like Vimochana have held
public hearings to bring to light the severity of
the problem of ‘dowry deaths’.The low conviction
rate of perpetrators of crimes against women
reveals the need to improve various aspects of
the criminal justice system.
Women, who are victims of various atrocities
such as dowry, rape, sexual harassment, domestic
violence, etc. are subjected to physical and mental
torture besides having to face social and financial
problems. DWCD’s Santhwana (2001-02)

scheme provides legal assistance, financial
relief, temporary shelter, and protection to such
victims, and helps them to become self-reliant
by providing training. The Santhwana centres
are run through NGOs, with preference given to
NGOs that are running short-stay homes. Family
Counselling Centres are actively working in the
field of women’s welfare. Santhwana is being
implemented in all the 27 district headquarters
and 18 selected taluks. There are 46 Santhwana
centres in the state. The assistance provided to
these women ranges from immediate relief, to
rehabilitation. Services include toll-free women’s
help line, short-stay homes, counselling services,
legal assistance; as well as space in working
women’s hostels, financial assistance, and
training for income generation. A review of the 19
Santhwana centres run through Mahila Samakhya
Karnataka (Mathrani 2004) points out that the
scheme has failed to make real choices available
to women in need. Opting out of violent situations
translates into various needs – referral services,
legal help, medical help, livelihood/vocational
help, temporary stay, and child care to name a
few. The Santhwana centres are so under-funded
as to be only partially effective.

Opting out of violent
situations translates into
various needs – referral
services, legal help,
medical help, livelihood/
vocational help,
temporary stay, and child
care to name a few.

However, poor funding is not the only concern.
While government initiatives including
Santhwana, all women police stations (AWPS),
and family counselling cells have attempted to
address gender-based crimes including domestic
violence, rape, sexual abuse, and dowry
harassment, efforts are severely constrained
by several factors in addition to the fact that
funds are short and real choices are seldom
made available to women. A research study
undertaken to study responses to domestic
violence in Gujarat and Karnataka (SNDT
Women’s University 1999) covered case studies
of AWPS. The findings reveal poor quality
services and low rates of utilisation. Reasons
include the long distances that women have to
travel to reach the stations, and an emphasis on
family reconciliation, regardless of the severity of
the case. Sometimes even female officers often
perceive domestic violence as a ‘private’ matter
and ignore prescribed investigative procedures.
The research by HHS found that counsellors in
189

Gender and Human Development

family counselling cells typically do not get the
required capacity building to offer meaningful
support and solutions to victims; instead, many
continue to emphasise the primacy of the
family over the survival needs of the woman.
The fundamental problem is that of lack of real
options to marriage, hence, the emphasis is often
on ‘saving the family’, even though that may not
be in the interest of the woman victim since the
family is the source of the problem.

The reservation for
women in local bodies
and the increased
presence of women
in public life and in
leadership roles has
reshaped gender roles.

There is a need for interventions that can offer
more meaningful options to women who seek
help. Vocational training options need to be
increased, especially since most of the traditional
ones – embroidery, tailoring, doll making, etc.
– do not provide the economic independence
required to meet women’s livelihood needs.
For women victims of violence, shelters and
short-stay homes that can provide child care
assistance, training, comprehensive counselling
and assistance for housing and employment are
vital.

Political participation at the grassroots
The representation of elected women
representatives (EWRs) in the panchayat tiers
is the highest in Karnataka as compared to the
rest of the country (Table 8.17). Women occupy
one-third of the decision-making positions in all
three tiers (Table 8.18).
The presence of a critical mass of women in
the political sphere changes the way society
perceives women (from homemaker to leader).
Second, as women in Panchayat Raj Institutions
(PRIs) reduce their political dependence on male
patrons and are backed by women’s groups at
the grassroots, a gradual shift towards a politics
based on women’s constituency emerges. The
reservation for women in local bodies and the
increased presence of women in public life and
in leadership roles has reshaped gender roles.
Shifts in gender roles within the households of
EWRs, as well as the interactions of EWRs with
government and other agencies are important
components in this transformation. A study of
women in local self-governance in Karnataka
(Stephen and Raja Sekaran 2001), notes that

190

35.6 per cent of women EWRs achieved a
moderate level of economic empowerment
after becoming gram panchayat members while
there was a distinct increase in the level of self
confidence in almost 97 per cent. According to
them, being gram panchayat (GP) members
had a positive impact on their personal abilities
such as communication skills and the capacity to
get things done. Their fear of contacting officials
and interacting with other villagers diminished.
At the community level, 31.5 per cent showed
a high degree of transformation. These women
gained the confidence to participate in public
functions, take up social issues like alcoholism
and work for improvement of their villages.
Their level of political awareness and knowledge
about programmes also increased. Research
studies also indicate that at least some EWRs do
grow into assuming leadership roles within the
community that challenge traditional patriarchal
leadership constructs. Changing role definitions
even triggers a process of ‘a redefinition and
engendering of leadership notions’, which is
‘radically different from the traditional view of
leaders being charismatic public speakers and
being overtly strong’ (Purushothaman, Anil
Kumar, and Purohit, 1999). Changes in gender
role perceptions also seem to be gradually getting
institutionalised. While field level government
officials with whom the EWRs interact often
resent having to deal with women, it has been
observed that over time, such interactions gender
sensitise government machinery at the field level
(Jain, 2001).
Several first-term women are either proxies
for male relatives and/or entrenched political
powers. Under these circumstances, it is natural
that most EWRs only represent the existing
dominant power structures, and not the interests
of women as a political constituency. In fact, most
first term EWRs are so apologetic about their
newly acquired position that they go out of the
way to insist that they owe their positions to their
male relatives, or some powerful groups in the
community. Such ‘humility’ can be understood as
a typical response when women assume a public
role not sanctioned by prevailing gender and
caste norms. Additionally, EWRs, like their sisters

elsewhere, often have to face harassment, verbal
and physical. Women activists are often concerned
about a lack of gender sensitivity among EWRs
who represent known dominant concerns of the
caste/community and do not seem to show any
extra ordinary concern in this phase for specific
gender-related issues.
The fact that initially new EWRs strongly identify
and align with and represent dominant concerns,
and adopt postures that do not challenge
entrenched power structures can be attributed in
part to an attempt to negotiate their transition into
new situations and roles. Interviews with EWRs
also highlight women’s growing enchantment
with newly acquired positions of power: ‘True

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

we came through our men the first time and are
often proxies for them, but we now know what
it is about and will come on our own the next
time’ (Singamma Sreenivasan Foundation,
2003).
A different scenario awaited second-term EWRs.
This time the government and NGOs were geared
and ready for them with training in the functioning
of the PRIs, education, health, environment,
greater gender sensitisation and legal literacy.
Capacity building initiatives have strengthened
EWRs’ ability to come into their own, as political
persons. Training has been an important aid in
enabling women to build confidence and move
towards greater independence. The government
has taken a lead in providing training and
communication support to elected women
members of Panchayat Raj institutions through
a range of methods – satellite-based training
programme, district level training programme
through departmental functionaries and NGOs,
and the distribution of hand books and video
cassettes on the Panchayat Raj Act.
The greatest opportunity in the emergence of
EWRs in such large numbers, however, lies in the
development of women as a political constituency,
and in the EWRs orienting themselves to this
constituency. However, even at its best, this
political axis based on gender, will only work in
relation to the dominant axes of caste and political
groupings.

Women’s activism, therefore, has developed new
forms in the new institutional space of PRIs.
Networking among EWRs and the formation of
federations has enabled greater effectiveness,
and provided a platform for sharing information,
strategies and experiences. Known as ‘okkutta’
these panchayat women's associations in
Karnataka are becoming pressure groups for
joint action for women’s empowerment where
earlier individual EWRs had found themselves
unable to make a dent. This phenomenon has
been accompanied by the growing spread
of women’s self-help groups and sanghas
supported by government/donor programmes.
These community based organisations (CBOs)
are emerging as key nodes of women’s
empowerment in rural Karnataka. SHGs or
sanghas are important breeding grounds for
effective EWRs. Many sanghas are supporting
and even putting up candidates for PRIs, as is
borne out in the experience of Mahila Samakhya,
Karnataka. Surely, these candidates, unlike those
propped up by male relatives, will have their
political constituency specifically among women.
Supported through training, and federated for
strength and reach, these EWRs oriented to the
women’s constituency could lead to real political
empowerment of women in rural Karnataka.
Conversely, active EWRs have also been setting
up women’s sanghas in their villages, taking
further the process of social, economic and
political empowerment of women.

Women’s activism has
developed new forms
in the new institutional
space of PRIs.

The Karnataka Women’s Information and Resource Centre Project
The Karnataka Women’s Information and Resource Centre – an NGO project- has set up federations of EWRs
in 6 districts of Karnataka – Bellary, Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Koppal and Raichur. The purpose is to use the
federations as:
• A support system for EWRs that would facilitate learning through mutual sharing;
• A space for EWRs to share women’s issues which are common across party and other lines;
• A platform for local women politicians to make their collective voice heard right up to the state and
national levels; and
• A medium for associations of EWRs to eventually become a part of the larger women’s movement and get
linked to other coalitions such as the National Alliance for People’s Movements.

Assessment
This chapter has examined the recent trends in
Karnataka and its major regions in areas that are
key to the question of gender equality in human
development – work and wages, the sex ratio,
women’s autonomy (including violence against
women) and political participation.

and providing reservation in recruitment for
government jobs.
While there has been some improvement
in girls’ access to education, progress is still
slow and large differentials remain.
The economic position of women in terms
of work participation, the proportion of
marginal workers, the dependence on
agricultural work, the share of agricultural
wage labour, and the differential in
agricultural wages, all point to a significant
worsening in women’s position in the
Hyderabad Karnataka region and to a
somewhat lesser extent in the Bombay
Karnataka region. The fruits of Karnataka’s
economic IT-led boom have definitely not
reached women in these regions and their
positions are worse than before.
Health indicators point to some improvements
but there is a serious situation developing
with respect to HIV incidence among women
in poor, rural areas where the public health
system is already weak.
The child sex ratio has worsened especially
in the better-off districts, pointing to the
dissonance between overall economic
improvement and human development
and lack of reduction in the aversion to
daughters.
Violence against women due to the spread
and intensity of dowry demands among
other reasons threatens the lives of women
in all socio-economic groups and regions.
Elected women’s representatives oriented
to the women’s constituency could lead to
real political empowerment of women in
rural Karnataka. Active EWRs have also been
setting up women’s sanghas in their villages,
taking further the process of social, economic
and political empowerment of women.

The assessment also points to some gaps and
limitations. The analytical framework identified
four sets of actions that the government must
undertake in order to protect girls and women
from harm, and promote gender equality as a core
element of human development. The government
should support changes in social norms and
practices; promote key legal/political changes;

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

create strong institutions at multiple levels from
the village to the highest levels; and provide
resources and make investments.

BOX 8.4

Some recommendations of the Karnataka Task Force on Women’s
Empowerment

The conclusions are that significant changes have
happened in the political sphere, largely due to
the growing involvement of women as EWRs.
Here, Karnataka is a pioneer in devolving powers
to PRIs and introducing reservation for women.
Another major area in which change appears
to have occurred is in the proliferation of selfhelp groups as the prime vehicle for women’s
economic empowerment.The picture here is more
mixed as many groups exist only on paper, and
others are weak in terms of resources, capacity
building, or other support. The conclusion here is
that the potential certainly exists and there are
surprisingly good outcomes, as the survey shows.
This has to be set-off against the results of the
analysis of the trends in the area of work and
wages that point to growing impoverishment of
women and inequality between the regions, and
therefore, greater economic need.
The score card on most other areas of potential
government action shows the need for
improvement. Much more needs to be done to
change social norms and values, or strengthen
the gender sensitivity of the criminal justice
system. Where institutions are concerned, the
key department for the development of women,
children and the disabled is poorly funded, and
weak in terms of staffing and capacity. It also
tends to be viewed as marginal and reflects the
overall perspective of the government, which is
still ‘welfarist’ in its view of women. There is need
for a strategic vision towards gender equality in
which different elements of governmental action
can fit.
When introduced, the Karnataka Mahila
Abhivrudhi Yojane or KMAY (for an analysis,
see chapter 3 Part III) held out the potential
for a truly pioneering effort. But its effects
have been reduced, over time, to a mechanical
counting exercise rather than any real attempt
to mainstream gender into the functioning of
key departments. Perhaps most significant of all
for the theme of this report, the gender audit of

In March 2000, on International Women’s Day, a task force was established to study programmes
and policies for the overall development of women in Karnataka. The Task Force on Women
Empowerment submitted its report in September 2002. Some of the important recommendations
made by this task force are:
• A centre for women’s empowerment, which will evaluate the impact of policy and programme
interventions to be established;
• An appropriate mechanism for tracking expenditure of funds earmarked for women to be
set up;
• Reservation for women in all commissions and boards/councils that the government sets
up;
• 50 per cent reservation for the development of women and girl children in the area
development fund of legislators;
• A Women’s Protection Cell to be set up at every village;
• A women’s university to be established in Karnataka;
• Special centres that provide training for competitive exams for the IAS and KAS need to be
set up for girls;
• The government should sanction additional funds for girls’ education for the next three
years;
• All committees constituted at the local level for development programmes and schemes
must have 50 per cent reservation for women;
• Part-time employment for women should be encouraged through policy intervention,
especially in the private sector;
• The Stree Shakti scheme must be expanded, and Stree Shakti groups need to be linked
with creches, with food preparation for anganwadis, stitching uniforms and bags for school
students, running PDS shops, and with NABARD; and
• Information about laws and legal redressal must be compiled in a comprehensive publication
and made available to all government agencies.

budgets and financing points to insufficiency in
the availability of resources for women.

Recommendations


First, it is critical to ensure there is an effective
and well-resourced lead institution to
spearhead action. Experience the world over
indicates that women’s departments, ministries
and bureaus remain weak, poorly resourced
and marginal in their impact unless they are
effectively placed within the government.
Currently, the triple responsibility of DWCD for
women, children and disabled people means
there is inadequate focus on gender. Women
number almost half of the people of the state
and a separate focus is essential if their current
marginalisation is to change. This department
195



needs to be adequately resourced, which is
very far from being the case at present.
Second, the department should be renamed
the department for Women’s Empowerment
and Gender Equality. Karnataka would be
the first to do this.
The department must develop a strategic
plan with clear timelines, achievable short
and long-term goals, and clear actions
to meet those goals. In developing the
strategy (including a vision and mission),
the department should interact closely
with people’s representatives, civil society,
academics and NGOs.
The effort at mainstreaming through KMAY
must be given greater direction and focus so
that the departments involved can have their
capacity for doing work for gender equality
significantly improved.
Top priority should be given to improving
women’s economic situation in the Hyderabad
and Bombay Karnataka regions.
There is urgent need to increase girls’
enrolment in secondary education throughout







the state and especially in the northern
districts.
Improvements in the healthcare system
especially in the Hyderabad Karnataka region,
and with special attention to the feminisation
of HIV/AIDS are of critical importance to
preventing a major health disaster.
The department should develop a major public
education campaign against sex selection,
dowry, and violence against women. This
needs to be coordinated with the police and
legal system where gender sensitisation and
accountability need strengthening.
Improvements are required in the data
and information systems that will allow
the effective monitoring and review of
programmes for gender equality.

These changes can provide the strategic focus and
direction that is missing at present.They constitute
the next step towards fulfilling the promise of full
and equal citizenship that the Constitution of
India makes towards the women of the state and
the country.

Stree Shakti and Swashakti women’s self-help groups: A Survey

Introduction
There are over 1,95,585 self-help groups
(SHGs) in Karnataka under various departmental
programmes, the majority of which are WSHGs or
women’s self-help groups, a strategy which has
emerged world wide as the single most significant
economic development programme for women.
An SHG is a small (12-20) group of poor people
who voluntarily come together to address their
poverty and other social issues.The core activity is
mobilisation of small savings from group members
and group lending from accumulated savings
as well as bank loans. It is for this reason that
SHGs are also known as microfinance or microcredit institutions. Poor people who are viewed
as security risks by the formal banking system
are, thus, enabled to access small loans for both
income generation and consumption purposes.
The SHG also offers its members a much-needed
space for dealing with economic, social and family
problems in a group environment. This process,
can contribute considerably to the ‘empowerment’
of SHG members though the actual effects of
such empowerment may often be transitory or
insubstantial if the programme design fails to
support empowerment enhancing in a concrete
manner.
As some writers2 have observed, both
governments and donor agencies are promoting
microfinance programmes as a blueprint for
simultaneously dealing with both poverty
alleviation and women’s empowerment.
Identified improvements include not merely
an increase in women’s income levels but also
control over their income; greater appreciation
of women’s contribution to the family income
leading to a perceptibly stronger role in
household decision-making about expenditure,
children’s education, marriage of daughters and
overall family welfare, and an enhancement

of women’s participation in community
decision-making resulting in more political space
for women.
In Karnataka, conveying services to poor
women through self-help groups has emerged
as the dominant strategy for combating female
poverty. The state has several programmes
running SHGs and two of the most significant
schemes in terms of funding and outreach are
Stree Shakti and Swashakti, both of which are
implemented by the Department of Women and
Child Development. In terms of magnitude,
Stree Shakti is amazing: on July 1, 2005, the
programme had 1,00,000 groups with an
accumulated savings of Rs.2,88,55,99,002;
62,281 groups have taken loans of
Rs.2,69,30,68,612 from lending institutions
and disbursed loans of Rs.7,30,40,29,967;
Rs.5,11,30,55,592 has been repaid to SHGs and
a sum of Rs.1,94,81,32,653 has been repaid to
banks. Swashakti was a smaller programme, cofinanced by IFAD-IDA and it closed in June 2005.
The Karnataka State Women’s Development
Corporation (KSWDC) managed the Swashakti
scheme to form SHGs through NGOs in 7
districts – Kolar, Tumkur, Chitradurga, Bellary,
Koppal, Raichur and Gulbarga. Thirty-six NGOs
had been contracted to work in 979 project
villages, and they formed 2,100 SHGs with
38,508 members.

In Karnataka, conveying
services to poor women
through self-help
groups has emerged as
the dominant strategy
for combating female
poverty.

Objectives of the study
The single largest government sponsored
economic development programme for women
employs the SHG strategy but, with self-help
groups having their origins in NGO-driven projects,
there is some scepticism about the government’s
capacity to manage such programmes, more
specifically when they have been upscaled very
rapidly as with Stree Shakti. The objectives
of the study were to assess the performance
and measure the impact of the SHGs formed
under two government sponsored programmes,

form more than half of the
membership of the
SHGs surveyed, with

the members. The
composition of the groups
therefore is well weighted
in favour of the more
vulnerable socio-economic
sub-groups.

Stree Shakti and Swashakti, with reference to:
• The functioning of SHGs as micro-credit
institutions;
• Their effectiveness in reducing poverty;
• Their effectiveness as gender empowerment
catalysts;
• Their role in effecting changes, if any,
in women’s status in the family and the
community;
• Their effectiveness as agents of socioeconomic change; and
• The adequacy of inputs provided to SHGs by
government.

Methodology
The survey was conducted along with a sample
survey of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SCs
and STs) by the Department of Economics and
Statistics (DES 2004B) although the two studies
are separate and distinct. However, SHGs formed
from 2000-01 onwards, under Stree Shakti and
Swashakti, have been selected primarily from
the very same villages sampled for the SC/ST
survey. One distinct advantage of conducting
this study along with the study on SCs and STs
is that the sample gives fair representation to SC
and ST women who are among the most socioeconomically underprivileged people in their
villages. Out of the 411 selected SHGs, 373 are
Stree Shakti SHGs and 38 are Swashakti groups.

After the selection of an SHG, a maximum number
of 10 group members was selected randomly and
schedules canvassed.

Profile of SHGs
Of the 2,753 self-help groups in the selected (for
the Sample Survey) villages and SC/ST habitations
with a gross membership of 38,330, a high 91
per cent (2,513) were functional on the date of
survey (November 2004). The non-functioning of
some groups was attributed to great poverty (87
per cent of the membership was below the poverty
line) and low literacy levels of the members (37
per cent) as well as lack of motivation and capacity.
The average membership per SHG was about 14.
The formation of 77 per cent (315) of the surveyed
groups (411) was facilitated by anganwadi workers
(AWs), 8 per cent (32) by NGOs, 7 per cent (31)
by government agencies/officials, 2 per cent (8) by
banks, 3 per cent (12) by gram panchayats and 3
per cent (13) by others.
As Table 8.5.1 reveals, Scheduled Caste women
form more than half of the membership of the
SHGs surveyed, with Scheduled Tribes, minorities
and backward classes constituting another sizable
26 per cent of the members. The composition of
the groups therefore is well weighted in favour of
the more vulnerable socio-economic sub-groups.
There is also homogeneity among members in

terms of geographic location (88 per cent) and a
shared socio-economic background (75 per cent).
This is a critical element in facilitating harmonious
and cooperative group dynamics since disparities
of caste, class or even location can be formidable
barriers to ensuring the formation of a cohesive
WSHG.

Chairpersons
The literacy rate among the chairpersons
(60 per cent) of the groups is higher than the state
female literacy rate (57 per cent). Of the literate
women, 25 per cent had studied up to class VII
16 per cent had studied from classes VIII to X
(but failed the SSLC), 14 per cent (59) had passed
the SSLC, and 6 per cent (23) had studied up
to PUC (class XII). The majority of chairpersons
(46 per cent) are between 21 and 34 years
of age, and 37 per cent are in the age group
35–54 years and a sizable number, 14 per cent are
very young women, below 21 years. The relative
youthfulness of the chairpersons is an interesting
trend. The economic profile of the chairpersons
shows that 87 per cent are below the poverty
line (BPL). Half of them are either casual workers
or daily wage earners, 15 per cent are from the
farming community, 16 per cent work at home,
9 per cent are from the salaried class, and 4 per
cent operate micro businesses. Nearly two-third of
the chairpersons are SCs, 14 per cent are STs, 5
per cent are from the minorities, 7 per cent from
the backward classes and 13 per cent are from
other communities.

Office bearers
The educational qualifications of the office bearers
of the SHGs also indicate a relatively high level of
literacy (54 per cent). Overall, chairpersons have
better educational attainments than office bearers.
Close to one-third had studied up to class VII,
12 per cent between class VIII and X, 7 per cent
had passed the SSLC, and 2 per cent had passed
PUC and 1 per cent were graduates. Age-wise,
office bearers are a youthful lot, with over half in
the age group 21-34 years, 32 per cent in the age
group 35-54 years, and 12 per cent of the office
bearers were very young, less than 21 years.
A high 88 per cent of the office bearers are BPL.
Nearly two out of three of the office bearers are
either daily wage or casual workers, 8 per cent are
from the salaried class and a mere 2 per cent are
from petty/small trade, 10 per cent work at home
performing house work.
The data clearly indicates that (i) there is
homogeneity in the composition of the SHG in
terms of age and socio-economic characteristics
while educational attainments show considerable
variation and (ii) the chairpersons and office
bearers share the main characteristics of group
members and, in that sense, are eminently
suitable representatives. Neighbourhood based
groups with a homogeneity of interests and a
decentralised style of functioning ideally perform
better as platforms for women’s participation than
heterogeneous groups with disparities between
members.

In 361 SHGs or 87 per cent, every member had

Linkages with lending institutions
SHGs have several sources of working capital,
i.e. members’ savings, revolving funds from

institutions that lend to SHGs in the ratio of 1:10.
Grameen banks contributed a third of the credit

26.8 per cent, cooperative banks contributed
17.3 per cent and 5.4 per cent came from NABARD.
Seventy three per cent of the SHGs repaid loan
instalments regularly. In the remaining cases,
a high 66 per cent said that they had defaulted
on repayments because their members were not
repaying loans in time and 21 per cent admitted
to not having control over their members so they
could not enforce repayment.
SHGs received loans at fairly stiff rates of interest: in
47.2 per cent of SHGs, the interest was 10 per cent,
in 28 per cent of the SHGs, the interest charged
was over 15 per cent and in 10 per cent of the
cases, interest ranged between 10 and 12 per cent.
This in turn, led to SHGs charging their members
a fairly high rate of interest: 54.7 per cent of the
groups charged 15 per cent on loans to members
and 42.1 per cent charged less than 10 per cent.
Micro-credit does not come cheaply.

Lending profile
A sum of Rs. 114.25 lakh has been disbursed
as loans to 63 per cent of SHG members. Of the
members who received credit, about 47 per cent
are BPL. About 5 per cent found it difficult to
get loans for various reasons such as not having
repaid an earlier loan and because they sought
frequent loans. A very high 73.4 per cent had
taken one loan, 21.2 per cent had taken two loans,
3.7 per cent had taken three loans and 1.8
per cent had taken four loans. Loan amounts were
for small sums, ranging from less than Rs.1,000 to
over Rs.10,000. The largest number of loans was
for amounts in the range of Rs.1,000-2,500 (44.4
per cent) and Rs.2,500-5,000 (18.5 per cent).
The region-wise break up of BPL members who
accessed credit is as follows: Bombay Karnataka:
65 per cent, Hyderabad Karnataka: 30.8 per cent
and south Karnataka: 53.19 per cent.
This raises a very crucial issue from the perspective
of the effectiveness of these programmes as a

poverty reduction strategy. These SHGs have a BPL
membership of 87 per cent, yet only 47 per cent of
the loans were disbursed to BPL women, indicating
that the most economically vulnerable women are
not accessing credit. Since loans are given based
on individual member’s savings, it would seem BPL
members could not leverage loans because they did
not save enough. The absorption with repayment
also means that SHGs may exclude those likely to
have difficulties in repaying loans, i.e. the poorest.

Purpose for which loans were taken

Grameen banks
contributed a third of the
credit leveraged by groups
from financial institutions.

About 45 per cent of the loans were taken for
economic activities: income generation activities
(24.70), on-farm activities (13.3), and business
(7.2). The remaining could be classified as
consumption loans: house construction (11.1 per
cent), festivals/functions (10.7), healthcare (9.2)
and children’s education (8).

Loan repayment by members
Repayment of loans shows 86.6 per cent
compliance. Apparently, in countries as diverse as
Bangladesh, Benin, the Philippines and Dominica,
IFAD reports that repayment is as high as
96-97 per cent. The main reasons members
cited for non-payment of loan instalments were
financial constraints and pressure from the spouse
or the family to defer repayment.
How important is the micro-credit function of the
SHG to its members? Very important, since other
sources of credit were insignificant: friends and
relatives helped 12.2 per cent of the members
while another six per cent turned to moneylenders.
Sixteen per cent of the members still owed
money on loans ranging from less than Rs.1,000
(19 per cent) and over Rs.10,000 (17 per cent).

Impact

SHGs have a BPL
membership of
87 per cent, yet only
47 per cent of the loans
were disbursed to BPL
women, indicating that
the most economically
vulnerable women are not
accessing credit. Since
loans are given based
on individual member’s
savings, it would seem
BPL members could not
leverage loans because
they did not save enough.

The impact of microfinance goes beyond income
generation, as discussed earlier. The impact on
women’s social, community and gender roles has
also been studied in the survey. Impacts can vary
within schemes and between women. There are
differences between women engaged in different
productive activities. Sometimes those who are
better-off are able to access credit to the detriment
of the poorer members. Then there are individual
201

Gender and Human Development

differences between women engaged in similar
activities. One may be a good entrepreneur and
another may lack initiative (Mayoux, 1997).4
Hence, it is difficult to expect identical outcomes
from all microfinancing SHGs.

Economic benefits
Often, a microfinance scheme is judged purely
in terms of mobilisation of savings, lending and
repayment. The larger issue of reducing women’s
economic exploitation by either the market or her
family is not factored when preparing report cards
even while organisers loudly proclaim the scheme
is emancipating. Emancipation, however, does not
just happen as a by-product of microfinance.

assumption being that they are now more
articulate and aware of what they can access
under government schemes and have the ability
to get resources from departments. This is not
always the case. Only a quarter had participated
in mass literacy campaigns, health campaigns,
and the midday meal scheme (Akshara Dasoha)
respectively, 15 per cent were involved with
the public distribution system (PDS), and less
than 10 per cent in watershed development,
desilting tanks, SGSY and other employmentgeneration activities. Overall, the level of
linkages and interface with existing programmes
is low.

Control over money
Members reported an improvement in incomes
and the percentage of BPL members went
down from 87 per cent to 77.2 per cent while
the percentage of members above the poverty
line (APL) increased from 13 per cent to 22.8
per cent. As Table 8.22 reveals, the number of
women with a monthly income below Rs.1,000
declined by 18 per cent while the numbers in
all other income categories increased, i.e. by
12 per cent in categories two and three, and by as
much as 26 per cent in category four.
After such improvements, husbands’ contributions
to family income have sometimes come down but
here an overwhelming 90 per cent said it did not
happen.

Linkages with other government
programmes
SHGs are encouraged to avail of benefits
under various government programmes, the

For concrete economic empowerment to take
place, women should ideally have autonomy over
their own incomes.The survey looked at economic
autonomy from two perspectives: freedom to
spend and control over savings. In each category,
the number of women reporting full autonomy
went up considerably (Table 8.5.3).
Members’ autonomy in family decision-making
increased most remarkably with reference to
construction/repair of their houses where the
percentage of members making the decision
on their own shot up from 3.3 to 80.2 per
cent. Consultation with family before buying
household articles decreased only marginally from
71.3 to 68.2 per cent and actually increased,
from 72.5 to 83.7 per cent when buying durable
goods. Overall, members’ dependence on ‘others’
came down thereby pushing up the percentage of
members who made decisions on their own from
14.5 to 25.7 per cent regarding buying household

A high percentage (65.9) joined SHGs because
they encouraged savings, 17.3 per cent saw it as
a way of enhancing their social status and only
14.9 per cent had wanted to avail of credit.

What did they gain?

goods and buying durable goods (from 10.8 to
14.3 per cent). Disappointingly, the spillover into
other critical areas such as sending children to
school and medical expenditure was minimal.
There has been little significant improvement in
women’s autonomy here.

Clearly, members perceive that belonging to a
sangha enhances their social status and leads
to a sense of self-worth. An impressive 79.3
per cent saw their status in the family improving
significantly and 71.2 per cent saw this
translating into an improvement in their status
in the community.There was an increase in social
networking (66.3) and greater participation in
social, cultural and political activities.

Decision to take loans

Changes in family relations

Before joining the SHG, 66.8 per cent of the
women reported consulting the family before
taking a loan and 19.4 per cent decided on their
own. After joining the SHG, dependence on the
family declined to about 61 per cent while the
percentage of members making decisions on
their own increased to 33.5 per cent.

A third of the women noted that their spouses
and/or other family members had altered habits
such as smoking, drinking and using tobacco/pan
masala but another third had seen no changes.
Did women see any changes in their lives in the
context of violence meted out to them by spouses
and other family members? Of the 4,084 women
canvassed only a quarter chose to respond. This,
itself is significant since domestic violence is not a
subject many women like to acknowledge. Those
who responded saw a more than 50 per cent
reduction in physical violence arising out of issues
such as dowry, childlessness, no son, quarrels over
property with the spouse and in-laws.

Problems encountered
A significant majority did not encounter resistance
from spouses or older family members while they
dealt with the process of group membership. The
majority faced no objections regarding the training
programme (89 per cent), dealing with banks and
offices (62.2), and spending time on committee
work (56.6) and dealing with other members’
family problems (53.0).

Women’s definition of programme
objectives
Over 96 per cent agreed that encouraging
savings was the principal objective, followed by
improving access to credit (86.6), and income
generation (86.1). Improving women’s status in
the family (82.0) and in the community (75.4)
was also perceived as an important objective of
the programme. Developing group action (74.4),
improving vocational skills (71.4) and enabling
access to markets (63.4) which are the core
objectives of SHGs, have obviously not made a
strong impact on women’s consciousness.

Improvement in knowledge/skills/
awareness

Programme goals in
both Stree Shakti and
Swashakti include
increasing women’s
knowledge and
awareness on a number
of levels ranging from
managing an SHG, soft
skills such as leadership
and communication
skills, to sensitisation
about gender, health and
education.

women with access to markets and enabling an
interface with institutions such as banks and
government agencies, promotes the accumulation
of skills and knowledge in participants. More than
half the women surveyed said they were aware
of issues relating to children’s education, health
and sanitation and family planning. The role of

the anganwadi worker in imparting information
about healthcare, nutrition and pre-school
education is an important aspect of the ICDS or
Integrated Child Development Scheme. Since the
anganwadi worker is also the facilitator for the
Stree Shakti groups, it is clear that she uses the
group as a forum for imparting information about
health and education quite successfully. Over 40
per cent claim to have derived improved levels of
knowledge, skills and awareness in many other
areas including gender equality (Table 8.5.4).

Community participation
Participation in gram sabhas or village assemblies,
which are statutory bodies constituted under
the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act 1993 where
many decisions are made regarding selection of
works or beneficiaries under various schemes,
is a crucial first step into both community and
political space for women and other marginal
sub-populations. As many as 83 per cent had
attended gram sabhas, with 38.4 per cent attending
6–10 gram sabhas and 24.8 per cent attending
two to five meetings. This level of participation in a
scenario where many villagers do not attend gram
sabhas regularly is very good. A small number
(11.4 per cent) had been elected to local bodies and
18.0 per cent were members of political parties.

Community and social activism
The performance of SHGs in dealing with
community and social issues is disappointing.
204

SHGs did better when it came to helping
members sort out personal problems. SHGs
had satisfactorily mediated property issues (78
per cent), ill treatment by spouses (76), family
quarrels about money (53), marital problems
(33) and advising members about addictive
habits like smoking, using pan and tobacco (21).
This indicates that women’s collectivism can and
does provide counselling services followed by
interventions where necessary.

How can the programme improve?
Women responded that must-haves are capacity
building in gender issues (62 per cent), legal
literacy classes (62.2 per cent) and training in
health issues (54.6 per cent). Some of the core
inputs were found wanting either because they
were insubstantial or because they were not
provided in time or both. Over 54 per cent found
the government subsidy inadequate and 27 per
cent said they did not get it in time. Over 51 per
cent were not satisfied with the training in book
keeping imparted to them and 21.9 per cent
said it was not conducted in a timely manner.
Bank lending was described as inadequate by
50.8 per cent and 23 per cent said it was not
given in time. Training in vocational skills needed
improvements according to 41.8 per cent
while 24.3 per cent noted it was not available
at all. Only 9.8 per cent said it was available.
Marketing support was another area which
needed improvement (47.4) and only 9.6 per
cent said it was available. A high 52.6 per cent
wanted improvements in literacy classes and 19
per cent said this facility was not available.
Clearly, SHG members are in a position to identify
areas where programme inputs must improve as
well as the knowledge and/or skills they need
to upscale incomes and enhance their capacity
as gender-class. Moreover, the household and
their status therein are critically important for

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

these women and constitute the first critical step
towards enlarging their choices.

Critical issues
At state level, only 62 per cent of the one lakh
SHGs formed under Stree Shakti have taken
loans from banks. The average saving per group
is Rs.28,856. Repayment to SHGs by members
is about 70 per cent which clearly needs to
improve. The Swashakti model was implemented
in 5 states including Karnataka. A baseline
survey was undertaken at the start of the project
and the World Bank claims that all-India data
indicates: (i) incomes of women increased from
Rs.4,300 to Rs.8,766; (ii) illiteracy among SCs
and STs declined from 74.3 to 30.9 per cent
and 78 to 55.7 per cent respectively; (iii) about
90 per cent of the women claimed access to and
control over their resources and 96 per cent had a
say in sending their daughter to school compared
with 21 per cent at baseline.

The difference between the two projects is that
Stree Shakti, which is bigger and has greater
coverage, has a more limited objective but
attempts to do a great many things on a tight
budget.
The survey points to the risks associated with
rapidly upscaling a project, as has happened
with Stree Shakti, without providing matching
budgetary support for programme inputs such as
training and revolving funds. It is also a matter
of concern that the poorest are unable to get
credit for various reasons. The poorest women are
the constituency the programme is supposed to
address. Since the main objective is to give credit
to the very poor and enhance their incomes, the
programme falls short here and more analysis is
needed so that this shortcoming is redressed.
The groups surveyed comprise primarily SC, ST
and backward class women, 87 per cent of whom
are below the poverty line. While group savings
and lending is small scale, group lending reached
the majority of the members. Repayment is higher
than the state average. Since some members
reported a decline in poverty from 87 to 77.2
per cent, the programme could be said to have

impacted rural poverty in a limited way. While
gender equity and empowerment in a larger
sense were not part of the Stree Shakti game
plan, the results in terms of an improvement in
women’s sense of self and self-worth are evident.
Enhancement of women’s status in the family and
the community was a spin-off that women rated
highly. If the groups have not been successful in
working as gender empowerment catalysts then it
is because the programme does not provide for it
by way of capacity building of either groups or the
facilitators. As agents of socio-economic change,
the groups were able to bring about changes

violence, which came down by 50 per cent. At
community and societal levels, the groups were
less visible. Participation in gram sabhas improved
and this is a significant step towards enlarging
women’s community participation.
The majority of the members wanted more
loans, more revolving funds and more capacity
building in book keeping, vocational skills,
marketing, health education and gender issues.
The importance of providing inputs in time was
repeatedly emphasised by groups.The best way of
ensuring that the programme shapes up to their
expectations is to build a strong participatory
element.The department must use these inputs to
improve the programme’s services.

Recommendations
Given the fact that SHGs are the preferred
anti-poverty strategy for women, it can be concluded

206

that the strategy has met with some success since
groups have reduced poverty, reached out to very
poor women and raised their awareness levels
quite significantly. An important caveat is that the
programmes have not reached the poorest women
who are not in a position to save and who are
poor credit risks. What Stree Shakti must now do
is to focus on the poorest women (BPL) who are
not getting credit for various reasons and ensure
their needs are met by linking them with local
rural wage employment programmes to build a
sustainable base for micro-credit. A second set of
actions must focus on strengthening/diversifying
the vocational base and developing marketing
linkages. Ensuring that services are provided in
time and efficiently speaks of the need for better
governance. Gender sensitisation, literacy, health
and nutrition awareness would be the third set of
actions. All actions must be complementary, not
sequential.
