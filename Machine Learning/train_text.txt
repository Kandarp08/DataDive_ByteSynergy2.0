Demography, Health and Nutrition
Introduction
Good health is an invaluable asset for better
economic productivity, both at the individual and
national level, but above all, it is valued by those
who own it as a prerequisite for a better quality of
life and better standards of living. Sub-populations
who are at the highest risk from poor health and
its effects on longevity and morbidity are the poor,
women, the Scheduled Castes and ScheduledTribes.
The main reasons for the high level of vulnerability
of these sub-groups are, first, the inaccessibility of
healthcare, and second, their inability to spend on
healthcare interventions. Public healthcare systems
must, therefore, provide that critical barrier between
ill-health and the ones who are most vulnerable,
but here too, factors such as financing and efficiency
greatly influence the quality and coverage of public
healthcare services.
The health scenario in Karnataka today is a
combination of achievements and challenges.
Significant advances have taken place in health
and healthcare services over the past decade. A
brief review of the key demographic indicators that
offer a reliable overview of the status of health in
Karnataka suggest that the state’s performance is
much better than the all-India average.The state’s
population increased from 4.49 crore in 1991 to
5.27 crore in 2001. A comparison of the decadal
growth of population shows a significant decline
from 21 per cent between 1981-91 to 17.5
per cent in 1991-2001. Life expectancy at birth
has increased to about 66 years in 2001. Infant
and maternal mortality are among the most
reliable indicators for assessing health status, and
Karnataka’s performance here, as in reducing
neonatal mortality, child mortality and maternal
mortality rates – all of which show a downward
trend – is better than the aggregated figures for
the whole of India (Table 6.1). In fact, Karnataka
is well on its way to achieving the Tenth Plan
objective of reducing MMR to 2 per 1000 births
by 2007. Institutional deliveries now account for
51 per cent of total deliveries, compared with 34

per cent for all-India. Small pox has been
eradicated; the state is free from plague and
guinea worm and the incidence of polio has been
considerably reduced. A widespread infrastructure
of health and medical institutions comprising
primary health centres offering basic services to
state-of-the-art super-speciality hospitals with
a national, and even international reputation, is
now in place.
There are, however, some challenges which the state
will have to confront with aggressive strategies.
Rural-urban disparities, far from diminishing, have
only intensified: for example, the infant mortality
rate (IMR) is 64 in rural areas as compared with
24 in urban areas (2004). There are noticeable
regional disparities in spite of overall improvements
in the various health indicators. The five districts of
northeast Karnataka – Gulbarga, Bidar, Koppal,
Raichur and Bellary – and two districts of northwest
Karnataka – Bagalkot and Bijapur – have worse
health indicators than the rest of the state. The
health status of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes is
cause for serious reflection because it is so distanced
from the health status of the total population.
Under-nutrition among pregnant women and
infants continues to take its toll. The incidence
of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis,
malaria and intestinal infections is still relatively
high. Now the state must confront HIV/AIDS and
the very human issues it brings to the fore. Lifestylerelated ailments like diabetes, heart disease, and
cancer are also registering an unwelcome increase.
Certain preventable health problems continue to

better economic
productivity, both at the
individual and national
level, but above all, it is
valued by those who own
it as a prerequisite for a
better quality of life and
better standards of living.

specific population groups. Although the maternal
mortality rate has declined, it is still unacceptably
high for a developed state like Karnataka.

Private sector participation in provisioning
healthcare services is still predominantly an
urban-based phenomenon. Rural areas must rely
on state sponsored healthcare. Here again, it is
the poor who are the single largest constituency
for public healthcare. It is for these reasons that
this chapter will focus on public health services in
the state since private sector-managed healthcare
does not target the sub-populations who are most
at risk and have the least capacity to spend on
their health needs.

Population
According to the 2001 census, since 1951 the
population of Karnataka has increased two and

a half times to 52.73 million. It progressively
increased between 1951 and 1981 but registered
a decline in growth, for the first time, in the
decade 1981–1991 i.e. from 26.75 per cent to
21.12. It further declined to 17.5 per cent in the
decade 1991–2001. Two critical demographic
trends which are now becoming visible, are an
increase in the size of the working population
(15 to 59 years) and a decrease in the below
15 population – both of which have significant
policy implications. The first is a possible increase
in joblessness if the economy is unable to provide
employment for this large labour force; the
second is the greying of the population over the
next 25 years, which will trigger a need for social
security. While Karnataka’s population growth
during the preceding decade is less than all-India
(21 per cent), it is higher than the neighbouring
states of Kerala (9.4 per cent), Tamil Nadu
(11 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (13.9 per cent),
indicating how imperative it is for Karnataka to
sustain this decline in decennial growth.

The crude birth rate (CBR), which was 33.7 in
1971, declined to 22.0 in 2002 – a decline of
about 35 per cent. The two neighbouring states
of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu recorded a
decrease of 41 and 42 per cent respectively during
the same period.The crude death rate (CDR) fell by
45 per cent to 7.2 in 2002 from 13.0 in 1971.The
states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
recorded a decline in CDR of about 30 per cent, 48
per cent and 50 per cent respectively during this
period. Across districts, Udupi has the lowest CBR
(15.8) and Koppal’s CBR of 28.8 is the highest in

Karnataka State Integrated Health Policy 2004
Based on the report of the Task Force on Health and Family Welfare (2001), the government formulated a
State Integrated Health Policy:
1. Providing integrated and comprehensive primary healthcare.
2. Providing a credible and sustainable referral system.
3. Establishing equity in delivery of quality healthcare.
4. Encouraging greater public–private partnership in the provision of quality healthcare in order to better
serve the under-served areas.
5. Addressing emerging issues in public health.
6. Strengthening health infrastructure.
7. Improving access to safe and quality drugs at affordable prices.
8. Increasing access to alternative medicine systems.

the state. At the regional level, the CBR is higher
in both the Hyderabad Karnataka and the Bombay
Karnataka areas than in south Karnataka. All
districts have experienced a substantial decline in
the CDR during the last decade.The decline in CDR
is higher in Bombay Karnataka and Hyderabad
Karnataka than in south Karnataka, probably
because the northern districts had such high crude
death rates to start with.
This decline in the CBR and CDR has been achieved
through changes in several socio-economic
and demographic variables over time. Many of
these factors relate to women’s unequal status
in society and any improvement in the following
parameters translates into an improvement, not
just in the CBR and CDR, but in many other health
indicators as well: women’s age at marriage,
their education levels, their participation in the
non-agricultural sector and per capita income.
Increasingly, Karnataka, over the last decade, has
witnessed many significant changes that have
favourably impacted its demographic profile. The
proportion of urban population increased from
30.9 per cent to 34.0 per cent, female literacy
increased from 44.3 to 57 per cent, the female
work participation rate went up from 29.4 per cent
to 32.0 and per capita income increased
from Rs.6,739 (1990-91) to Rs.11,516
(2001-02). At the same time, the age at
marriage for females increased to about 20 years
and the proportion of married females in the
age group 15-44 declined to about 75 per cent.
In addition to these changes, the reduction in
mortality as well as fertility can be attributed to
an improvement in medical facilities at different
levels and stages, as there has been a considerable
expansion of health institutions and staff, in both
public and private sectors.

have better survival rates than males.
The increase in LEB has brought about a
significant change in the profile of the population.
The proportion of the population in the age group
60 years and above increased from 7.6 per cent
in 1971 to 11.4 per cent in 1999. The percentage
of female population in the age group 60 years

the male proportion (7.9 per cent) in 1971 has

size of the aging population is reflected in the
emergence of various healthcare issues associated
with the elderly such as diabetes, heart disease,
diseases related to the nervous system and mental
health. With this greying of the population likely
to increase over the next decade, geriatric care
must become part of the focus of public healthcare
systems.

Morbidity
Morbidity rates are important determinants of
the health status of a population and provide
policy inputs to health planners. The NSS in its
52nd round on morbidity pattern has estimated
that about 4.4 per cent in rural population and
4 per cent in the urban population in the state were
ill during the period 15 days prior to the survey, i.e.
about 22 lakh persons are ill at any given point of
time, which is an indication of the magnitude of
the problem (Table 6.4). Increased morbidity levels
have an adverse effect on productivity, resulting in
chronic worker absenteeism, loss of person-days
and a reduction in income. The hardest hit are the
poor, who find their productivity levels falling at the
very moment that there are demands on their purse
to pay for treatment. Chronic bouts of illness or even
one episode can send a family over the poverty line
into indebtedness. NSS data throws light on the
reasons people give for not seeking treatment for
ill-health.The survey shows that the major reason is
that the ailment is not considered serious enough to
require attention.There have been some significant
changes between the two surveys, i.e. 1986-87
and 1995-96. Financial reasons gain in importance
as a reason for not taking treatment in rural areas

and both rural and urban areas report an increase
in awareness about health.
The NFHS, during its two rounds of surveys, provided
some valuable information on the prevalence of
some diseases. Between the two survey points
NFHS-1 and NFHS-2, the incidence of malaria
in the rural areas of Karnataka increased from
5 to 7.7 per 1,000 persons, while at the national
level, the incidence in rural areas recorded an
increase from 39 to 42.5 during the same period.
The incidence of malaria for the state as a whole
increased to about 21 during 2001 and declined to
about 10 during 2003. Areas with a high incidence
of malaria are Mangalore and Bellary along with the
project areas of the Upper Krishna Project (Almatti
and Narayanpura), which are highly susceptible.1
The prevalence of tuberculosis in Karnataka is about
3 per 1,000 persons in rural areas and 2.2 per
1,000 persons in urban areas (NFHS-2). However,
the overall increase was about 2.98 per cent during
1999–2003.2
The incidence of leprosy in Karnataka is low at
one per 1,000 persons and the latest data from
the National Leprosy Eradication Programme
reveals that the prevalence rate of leprosy in 2003
has further declined to 0.2 per 1,000 persons.
Leprosy is more prevalent in Gulbarga, Raichur,
Bellary, Koppal and Gadag, all north Karnataka
districts.

HIV/AIDS
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is caused by the HIV virus, which weakens the
body’s immune system and leads to death through
secondary infections. The first case of full-blown
AIDS in Karnataka was detected in 1988. Since
then, the prevalence of HIV and AIDS has been
rising and is a cause for concern with 24,236 HIV
cases and 1,730 cases of AIDS being reported
from 1988 to 2003. During the same period, 189
AIDS-related deaths were recorded.

The increase of HIV cases has been alarming,
particularly during the last two years. The
rate of increase during 2001-02 was 55 per
cent and during 2002-03, it increased to
106.2 per cent. Currently an estimated five lakh
people are infected with HIV. Karnataka has put a
good reporting and monitoring system in place,
unlike most of the reportedly ‘symptom-free’
states. The objectives of the government’s policy
are to keep HIV prevalence below three per cent,
to reduce blood-borne transmission to less than
one per cent, to achieve condom usage in not
less than 90 per cent of high-risk groups and
to ensure that awareness is created about HIV/
AIDS. In 2004, the state established 40 voluntary
counselling and testing centres (VCTCs) at the
taluk level for the prevention and care.

significant decline of about 45 per cent, from 95
in 1971. At the national level, the decline in IMR
is about 62 per cent though the estimated level of
IMR at both points of time is higher than that of
Karnataka (Table 6.6).
The various rates of IMR and child mortality rate
(CMR) by residence (NFHS-1 and NFHS-2) are
presented in Table 6.7. There has been a decline of
about two infant deaths per 1000 live births each
year. However, the SRS data on IMR for Karnataka
prior to both surveys showed a faster decline during
1971–81. Rural mortality rates are significantly
higher than the urban rates. If two segments of
IMR, viz. neonatal and post-neonatal are separated,
it is clear that the proportion of neonatal deaths to
the total IMR has shown a three percentage points
increase between two surveys as against a decline
of three percentage points in post-neonatal deaths.

The objectives of the
government’s policy are
to keep HIV prevalence
below three per cent,
to reduce blood-borne
transmission to less than
one per cent, to achieve
condom usage in not less
than 90 per cent of highrisk groups and to ensure
that awareness is created
about HIV/AIDS.

A sizeable decline of about 61 per cent has occurred
in the urban post-neonatal death rate.

There is a correlation
between high IMR and
the low socio-economic
standing of families,
gender disparity, illiteracy
and lack of institutional
support.

During 2001-02 Dakshina Kannada district (44)
had the lowest IMR followed by Udupi, Bangalore
Urban and Shimoga (45).The district with the highest
IMR is Dharwad (69) followed by Bijapur, and
Gulbarga (67), Bidar and Gadag (66). All districts
with an IMR higher than the national average are
in north Karnataka. Overall, the southern districts
in Karnataka present the best scenario with an IMR
of 50 compared with Bombay Karnataka (59) and
Hyderabad Karnataka (60). Karnataka will have to
step up its efforts to catch up with states like Kerala
(10) and Tamil Nadu (44). Currently, only the best
performing district is on a par with the Tamil Nadu
aggregate.
There has also been a drop of about 20 per cent
in child mortality and in under-five mortality.
Data on differentials in infant and child mortality
is not easily available, either at state or district
level. Different surveys (which have limitations)
provide some information on districts. Data
provided by NFHS-2 on differentials is useful for
understanding the influences of factors related to
infant and child mortality.
There is a correlation between high IMR and
the low socio-economic standing of families,
gender disparity, illiteracy and lack of institutional
support. Contributory factors to infant mortality
range from low per capita income, under-

representation of women in the non-agriculture
sector, early marriage for women, female illiteracy,
under-nutrition of both the mother and foetus,
high CBR and CDR, poor access to antenatal care
(ANC), low birth weight, unsafe deliveries and
the inadequate reach of the services provided by
the healthcare system. Kolar, Bijapur, Bagalkot,
Dharwad, Haveri, Gadag, Bidar, Gulbarga, Koppal,
Chikmaglur, Hassan, Raichur, Uttara Kannada,
Mysore, Mandya and Kodagu have an IMR higher
than the state average. While most districts have
some or most of the pre-disposing factors for high
IMR mentioned above, it is indeed surprising to
find the relatively better developed districts such
as Hassan and Kodagu performing poorly.
Infant death can occur at 2 stages: neonatal
and post-neonatal. Neonatal deaths take
place during the first 4 weeks of life and
post-neonatal deaths occur between 1 to 12
months of age. The incidence of both neonatal
and post-neonatal mortality can be reduced
significantly if the appropriate measures are
taken in time. Timeliness is crucial. About 0.40
lakh neonatal deaths take place annually in the
state. About 80 per cent of total infant deaths in
urban areas and 69 per cent of total infant deaths
in rural areas are neonatal deaths. This is also a
period when mothers are vulnerable, as evidenced
by the fact that most maternal deaths occur in the
four week period after child birth. The majority of
neonatal deaths are caused by the mother’s own
health status (which is normally poor because
of under-nutrition) resulting in low birth weight,
premature birth, asphyxia, infectious diseases,
pneumonia, tetanus, diarrhoea combined with
lack of access to institutional services.
Mortality rates are higher among infants born to
mothers who are below 20 years and above 30
years of age. A clear association is evident between
IMR and birth intervals.The IMR is quite high (98.8)
when the duration of the birth interval is less than
24 months and decreases with an increase in the
interval between births, for example, IMR is 32.3
when the birth interval is 48 months and above.
Since neonatal mortality is lower when the birth
interval is more than 24 months and the age of
the mother is in the age group 20-29, one way of

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

reducing neonatal mortality is to encourage young
couples to space births. Currently, only a low five
per cent use spacing methods. Bangalore Urban,
Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Uttara Kannada
are the few districts where more than 10 per cent
of couples use spacing methods.
Infant and child mortality declines considerably
with increases in standards of living (Table 6.9).
The poor are caught in a cycle of low income and
ill-health, which are mutually self-reinforcing. The
poor cannot afford the costs of a nutritious diet
or antenatal and post-natal care, the absence of
which can result in high-risk pregnancies which

mean either indebtedness or maternal death. High
rates of female illiteracy have very adverse effects
on the survival of mothers and their children in
terms of women’s lack of awareness of nutrition
or postpartum care.
The causes of death in infancy are the same for
boys and girls. Slow foetal growth because of
malnutrition is the major cause of death and
accounts for 33 to 34 per cent of infant deaths.
Birth asphyxia and other respiratory conditions
account for 26 per cent of infant deaths among
boys and girls. In the age group 1-4 years, injury
and other accidents are a major cause of mortality

Slow foetal growth because
of malnutrition is the
major cause of death and
accounts for 33 to 34
per cent of infant deaths.

Maternal mortality is a
crucial indicator of both
women’s health and of
gender justice, raising as
it does, questions about
women’s lack of control
over their own bodies.

among both boys and girls. These answer for
19 per cent of deaths among boys and
21 per cent among girls.The second most common
cause of death is diseases of the respiratory system,
which are predominant among boys (13 per cent),
and intestinal infectious diseases among girls
(12 per cent). Tuberculosis causes more than
7 per cent of deaths among children.

Immunisation of children
Immunisation of children against six serious but
preventable diseases viz. tuberculosis, diphtheria,
pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis and measles is
an important instrument of child survival. The
136

state’s programme also includes administration
of five doses of Vitamin A for the prevention of
night blindness and iron folic acid solution for
iron supplementation. The reproductive and child
health (RCH) survey of Karnataka (1998-99)
shows that the coverage is satisfactory except in
some of the northern districts. The immunisation
coverage for the children has improved in 14
districts other than Belgaum, Hassan, Kodagu
and Kolar (RCH 2004). The desired objective
of complete coverage seems quite attainable
in some districts, but the performance in
some others, like Raichur, is disappointing
indeed.

Maternal mortality
Women’s health encompasses many areas of
concern but since most female deaths are caused
by child birth, maternal mortality is a crucial
indicator of both women’s health and of gender
justice, raising as it does, questions about women’s
lack of control over their own bodies.
The maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Karnataka
is 195, which is substantially lower than all-India
(407) (Table 6.11). Among the southern states,
Karnataka is better than Kerala (198) but
has a higher MMR than Tamil Nadu (79) and
Andhra Pradesh (159). The leading causes
of maternal deaths in Karnataka are sepsis
(33 per cent) haemorrhage (27 per cent), anaemia
(13.3 per cent) and abortion (7 per cent). Deaths
caused by haemorrhage and obstructed labour can
be prevented if good obstetric care is available at
all times, but since such facilities are available only
in big urban hospitals, many rural women cannot
access emergency services in time. Eclampsia is
another leading cause of maternal mortality, which
can be prevented through regular antenatal care.
Abortions should be performed only in hospitals
where proper facilities are available, but ignorance
or fear of detection propels many women into the
doors of unqualified abortionists. As in the case of
infant mortality, and indeed the two are intimately
inter-related, the causes of maternal mortality are
a mix of factors such as women’s lack of control
over their reproduction, poverty, under-nutrition,
illiteracy and lack of accessibility to both anteand post-natal care.

Maternal and child health
services
Maternal and child health (MCH) services are the
two major components of the reproductive and child
health (RCH) programme that is provided through
primary health centres (PHCs) and sub centres
in the rural areas of Karnataka. In urban areas,
maternal and child health services are available
in government hospitals, urban health centres,
hospitals and clinics operated by NGOs and various
private nursing homes and maternity homes. MCH
has several components, of which, antenatal care
and institutional deliveries are critical to ensuring
safe delivery and maternal survival.
As we saw earlier, reducing neonatal deaths,
which constitute nearly 70 per cent of infant
deaths, would bring down the IMR significantly
and position the state within reach of achieving
the MDGs in both infant and maternal mortality.
The government strategy combines community
healthcare with institutional healthcare. Primary
healthcare is mainly provided by health workers
(ANMs) and traditional birth attendants (dais) who
are required to visit the homes of pregnant women
to ensure adequate antenatal care and to ensure
early identification of problem pregnancies.

Antenatal care
The proportion of pregnant women receiving
antenatal care (ANC) increased by about 3
percentage points between two surveys. In urban

areas, this proportion has increased much more
significantly than in rural areas. The proportion
of pregnant women among Scheduled Tribes
receiving professional care has declined though
there has been an increase among Scheduled
Caste women. Antenatal examinations by doctors
have also increased (Table 6.12).
The main components of the government’s
antenatal care programme are supply of iron and
folic acid tablets, tetanus (TT) immunisation, and
three ANC visits. The RCH rapid household survey
during 1997-98 provides information about
district level ANC services (Table 6.13). Coverage
of pregnant women by a complete ANC package
comprising a minimum three ANC visits, at least
one TT injection and supply of IFA tablets, varied
from a high 88 per cent in Kodagu to 26 per cent
in Bellary with the state averaging 60 per cent.
In northern Karnataka, while the coverage by any
type of ANC is high, coverage by the complete ANC
package is alarmingly low. Women who do not
complete the full course do not get the protection
required to withstand anaemia and tetanus and
potential problems are not identified in time for
treatment. The situation is more serious when
data on full ANC services of 2002 is analysed. It
shows that while coverage by any type of ANC
service has improved, the percentage of women
receiving full ANC has declined. One inference is
that healthcare staff was not able to ensure that
women who initially utilised ANC services were

Maternal and child health
services are the two
major components of the
reproductive and child
health programme that
are provided through
primary health centres
and sub-centres in the
rural areas of Karnataka.

motivated to complete the course. Possibly staff
failed to ensure full coverage for various reasons
ranging from lack of personnel to inadequate
supplies of drugs and diagnostic kits.

Institutional delivery
The second important focus of the reproductive and
child health (RCH) programme is safe delivery i.e.
delivery, should take place in hygienic conditions
and under the supervision of trained health
professionals. Safe deliveries are less likely to be
accessible to the rural poor and the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes for several reasons (Table 6.14).
There has been a considerable improvement in
the proportion of safe deliveries at the district
level though the number is low in northern
Karnataka. Women resort to home deliveries for
economic reasons primarily, although distance
from the health facility, customary practices and
lack of knowledge about the facilities available
are other reasons. The government has converted
400 primary health centres into 24-hour service
providers in 2005-06 to increase institutional
deliveries. This is a step in the right direction.

Family planning
The current contraceptive prevalence rate of 60
per cent is slightly higher than the all-India average,

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

which is 58.8 per cent. Female sterilisation (52.5
per cent) IUD (3.5 per cent) CC users (1.0 per cent)
and traditional methods (1.3 per cent) are the
principal methods. Male sterilisation is a low
0.7 per cent. The prevalence rate is highest in
Himachal Pradesh followed by West Bengal.
Women continue to bear a disproportionate share
of the responsibility for birth control although the
decision-making rarely rests with them. Among
districts, the prevalence rate varies from 39
per cent in Gulbarga to 75 per cent in Hassan.
Similarly, for spacing methods, Gulbarga records a
low prevalence rate of 0.9 per cent and Dakshina
Kannada records 11.4 per cent, which is not
satisfactory.

Nutrition
Nutrition is a significant determinant of good health
and the incidence of mal- and under-nutrition in
the community affects certain indicators such
as IMR and MMR adversely. For the poor, an
improvement in per capita income combined with
the availability of cheaper food is a step towards
ensuring higher levels of food consumption. The
status of nutrition is, however, also dependent
on food consumption patterns, which, in turn,
are shaped to a great degree by women’s status
relative to men. Custom dictates that women eat
least and last in the feeding order, followed closely
by children. Not surprisingly, the greatest levels of
poor nutrition occur among women and children.
An insufficient food intake and ignorance about
nutrition coupled with low immunity ensure that
the most vulnerable experience very fragile health.
In this context, the greatest changes can occur
only when there is an improvement in women’s
status and an enhancement of per capita food
availability.

Child nutrition
The NFHS-2 has examined the nutritional status
of children up to 3 years of age by weight-for-age,
height-for-age and weight-for-height. Children
who are more than -2SD below the reference
median on any of the indices are considered
to be undernourished and children who are
more than -3SD below the reference median
are considered to be severely undernourished.

classified as undernourished by selected
characteristics. About 44 per cent of children
below three years of age are underweight and
about 37 per cent are stunted. The proportion
of children who are severely undernourished is
about 17 per cent according to the weight-forage and about 16 per cent according to heightfor-age. These figures are lower than India. The
level of wasting (weight-for-height) is about
20 per cent, which is higher than all-India (16
per cent). Girls are more underweight and stunted
than boys while boys are more waisted. Undernourishment is considerably higher among rural
children and among SC and ST children. The
importance of female education is flagged by
the fact that the children of illiterate mothers
are more undernourished than the children
of literate mothers and that the proportion of
undernourished children declines sharply with
an increase in the living standards of parents.
In 1998-99, the weight-for-age index
(a composite measure of chronic and acute
under-nutrition) showed that 43.9 per cent
of children below 3 years of age were underweight. This proportion is the highest among
the southern states though lower than all-India.
With regard to the height-for-age index
36.6 per cent of children below 3 years are
undernourished. Andhra Pradesh has the highest
proportion of undernourished children with 38.6
per cent while Kerala and Tamil Nadu have lower
proportions. According to the weight-for-height

The greatest changes can
occur only when there
is an improvement in
women’s status and an
enhancement of per capita
food availability.

index 20 per cent of children, below 3 years are
undernourished, the highest among southern
states and above all-India as well (Table 6.16).
The National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, in its
Rural Survey 2004 has more current information
on the nutritional status of rural children and
women of Karnataka. Table 6.17 presents the
proportion of children in the age group 1–5 years
according to three anthropometric measures.
It is thus clear that the nutritional profile of rural
children has improved over the last five years.
However, the height-for-age factor remains a
matter of concern. The average intake of food
(gm/day) for children (rural) also shows a
somewhat even distribution and a varied diet
(Table 6.18). Children are not consuming
enough protein as the proportion of children with
‘protein-calorie adequacy’ is 23.3 per cent of
the children in the age group 1-3 years and
31.6 per cent of the children in the age group 4-6
years. However, the scenario in Karnataka is better
than Tamil Nadu and Kerala for corresponding age
groups (NNMB, Rural Survey, 2004).

Anaemia in children
Anaemia has serious implications for children’s
mental and physical growth as well as making
them vulnerable to infectious diseases. The
high-risk group is children aged 6–24 months.
The level of anaemia for children age 6 to 35
months as measured in NFHS-2 (Karnataka)
shows that about 71 per cent of children have
some level of anaemia: 20 per cent are mildly
anaemic, 43 per cent are moderately anaemic
and 8 per cent are severely anaemic. Mainly,
boys, children in rural areas and SC and ST
children have high levels of anaemia (Table
6.19). The level of anaemia among children in
Karnataka is lower than in Andhra Pradesh and
all-India (Table 6.20).

Demography, Health and Nutrition

Women’s nutrition

About 42 per cent of
women in the reproductive
age are anaemic. All age
groups are uniformly
affected, with a slightly
higher prevalence in
younger ages, which is
a matter of concern, as
they constitute the largest
proportion of the fertile
population among women
in the state.

The consumption of a varied and nutritious diet is
crucial for the health of all people but particularly
for women in the reproductive age. For a
balanced diet adequate quantities of protein, fat,
carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins are required
and these are found in meat, fish, egg, milk, pulses,
cereals, vegetables and fruit. NFHS-2 data on the
consumption pattern among married women
(Table 6.21) shows that a majority consume
pulses and milk/curd at least once a week. More
than 90 per cent eat vegetables once a week and
about 54 per cent eat fruit at least once a week.
Women in urban areas consume a greater variety
of food items than rural women. The consumption
of all food items is relatively low among SC and
ST women. Women with a high standard of living
inevitably have the highest consumption of all
food items.
The nutritional status of the ever married
women is expressed through body mass index
(BMI). The BMI is the product of weight in
kilograms divided by squared height in metres
and expressed as (kg/m2). The cut-off point for
height, below which a woman can be identified
as nutritionally at risk, is in the range of 140-150
cm. The average height of women in Karnataka
is 152 centimetres (one cm taller than the
all-India average). The mean height for women

in Karnataka varies slightly among different
groups and only about 10 per cent are under
145 centimetres in height.
The mean BMI for women in Karnataka is 20 and
varies within a small margin of 19-23 in different
groups. About 39 per cent of women have a
BMI below 18.5 indicating a high prevalence
of nutritional deficiency. Nutritional deficiency is
higher among women who are from rural areas,
illiterate, low income and among SCs and STs.
(Table 6.22).
The percentage of women with BMI below the
norm is 38.8 in Karnataka as compared to 35.8
per cent for all-India. A comparison with the
southern states shows that Karnataka has the
highest proportion of women with BMI below the
norm (Table 6.23).

Anaemia among women
Given the inadequacy of their diet, iron deficiency
anaemia is widely prevalent among the ever
married women in the age group 15-49. About
42 per cent of women in the reproductive age are
anaemic. All age groups are uniformly affected,
with a slightly higher prevalence in younger ages,
which is a matter of concern, as they constitute
the largest proportion of the fertile population
among women in the state. In order of severity,

about 27 per cent are mildly anaemic, about 13
per cent are moderately anaemic and a little over
two per cent are severely anaemic. Women living
in urban areas have significantly lower levels of
all grades of anaemia compared to women in
rural areas. This may be an important pointer to
the levels of poor hygienic and environmental
sanitation in rural areas leading to a high
prevalence of intestinal worm infection. Women
from the SC and ST communities have a higher
prevalence of anaemia.
The proportion of anaemia among women in
Karnataka (42.4) is lower than all-India. Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have a higher prevalence
of anaemia than Karnataka (Table 6.25).

Birth weight
The weight of an infant at birth is an important
measure of the nutritional status of the mother
and an indicator of the child’s survival rate.
An infant with birth weight less than 2,500
grams is at high risk. It is also probable that
mothers with poor nutritional status will deliver
low-weight babies. The RCH survey data on
birth weight observed that about 20 per cent of
the infants were below 2,500 grams. In many
districts more than one-fifth of the infants were
reportedly under-weight. The lowest proportion
of under-weight babies was in Bangalore Urban
(9 per cent) and the highest in Dharwad district
(39 per cent). More than half of the districts had
more than 20 per cent under weight babies,

Public expenditure on
healthcare

State interventions in nutrition

Despite the importance of public healthcare
services to the poor who are its primary clients,
expenditure on health and family welfare in
Karnataka has not increased over the years and,
in reality, it marginally declined from about one
per cent of GSDP in 1990-91 to about 0.88
per cent of GSDP in 2002-03. It is apparent
that family welfare is not receiving adequate
budgetary support: medical and public health
expenditure grew by about 26 per cent, family
welfare expenditure increased by only 10 per cent
with two negative growth years during 1998-99
and 2002-03.

The Centre-state co-financed Integrated Child
Development Scheme (ICDS) was launched in
the country in 1975 on an experimental basis
in 33 blocks, one of which was T. Narsipura of
Mysore district (Karnataka). The scheme has
multiple objectives of which the improvement
of the nutrition and health of children (0-6
years), pregnant women and nursing mothers
is a significant component. There are now 185

Within medical and public health, there has been
an increase in the share of expenditure of urban
health services, rural health services and medical
education, training and research (Figure 6.1). The
share of urban health services in medical and
public health has increased from 38 per cent in
1990-91 to 44 per cent in 2002-03. The share
of rural health services in medical and public

ICDS projects in the state. Self-sufficiency in
food production in a country will not reduce
malnutrition among the poor particularly among
children and women unless food is available
at affordable prices. The Public Distribution
System (PDS) ensures that food grain procured
and stocked by the Food Corporation of India is
distributed to state governments for distribution
through fair price shops. In 2004, the Karnataka
government introduced the distribution of 10
kilograms of rice and wheat at Rs.3 per kg to
each yellow cardholder. While this intervention
will have a considerable impact on the diet of the
poor, it must be matched by building nutrition
awareness so that people can supplement their
diets with nutritious, locally available, vegetables
and fruits. Akshara Dasoha, the midday meals
programme for school children, which was
introduced in the seven educationally backward
districts of north Karnataka in 2002-03,
and was subsequently upscaled to cover the
entire state in 2003-04, is a major initiative
which will substantially enhance young children’s
nutrition levels.

health increased from about one per cent to only
about three per cent, which is low, given the
gap between rural and urban health outcomes.
Expenditure on medical education, training and
research increased from about 11 per cent in
1990-91 to 15 per cent in 2002-03. Overall,
however, there has been a decline in expenditure
on public health during the decade. The share of
public health in the budget has declined from
around nine per cent in 1990-91 to about six per
cent in 2001-02 (Figure 6.1).

While the expenditure on primary healthcare
has remained stagnant, tertiary healthcare is
increasingly getting a bigger share of resources.
This trend is unfortunate since investment in
primary healthcare represents better value for
money than spending on secondary and tertiary
facilities. Primary healthcare constitutes a social
priority sector as it targets rural areas and the
poor who cannot afford expensive private medical
care. The overall status in primary healthcare
expenditure is reflected in the state’s performance
with regard to several health indicators.
The financial statement of the Department of
Health and Family Welfare (excluding Medical
Education, Training and Research) provided in the
‘Departmental Medium Term Fiscal Plan’ (DMTFP)
shows that in 2001-02, about 69 per cent of the
revenue expenditure was employee-related and
towards transfer payments. Employee-related
expenditure constituted about 31 per cent and
transfer payments about 38 per cent of revenue
expenditure in 2001-02 (Table 6.26). This
classification underestimates the expenditure
related to employees because assistance to local
bodies, a substantial part of which is salary, is
included in transfer payments. As little as 19.55
per cent was spent on supplies, services and
maintenance all of which are important inputs
for improving the quality of services and ensuring
optimal outreach and efficient delivery.
In 2002-03, about 32 per cent of the total
expenditure on medical and public health was
spent through local bodies. Districts with poor
health indicators such as Belgaum, Dharwad,
Raichur and Koppal often receive less financial

Yashaswini health insurance for farmers
Yashaswini, a cooperative farmers’ healthcare scheme is a landmark initiative of the Karnataka
government. Launched in June 2003, the scheme has for the first time, addressed the major
health concerns of rural people who typically have no health insurance. A farmer who has been
a member of a co-operative society for at least 6 months can avail of the benefits of the scheme
by paying a nominal premium of Rs.60 per annum. The spouse and children are also eligible
to get benefits if they pay a premium of Rs.60 per person.
Beneficiaries under this scheme can approach a pre-identified network hospital for treatment.
The network hospital extends free out-patient services and diagnostic tests at concessional
rates. If surgery is required, then the network hospital takes necessary steps. The beneficiary
need not pay for surgery if the cost is below Rs.1.00 lakh for a single surgery and below
Rs.2.00 lakh for multiple surgeries. The network hospital gets its fees from the Yashaswini
Trust through the Family Health Plan Limited which is the implementing agency for this
scheme.
Under the scheme, so far over 1,600 surgical procedures costing up to Rs.1.00 lakh for a
single surgery and Rs.2.00 lakh for multiple surgeries are free for members. In the first phase,
16.01 lakh farmers enrolled as members and over 20 lakh farmers enrolled in the second
phase. 164 network hospitals have been identified all over the state under this programme.
About 1.10 lakh farmers have used the services provided under this scheme. About 86,000
free out-patient consultations and 24,122 surgeries have been conducted during 2003-04 and
2004-05. A payment of about Rs.28.56 crore has been made to network hospitals as fees for
cost of treatment.

Universal Health Insurance Scheme
The Universal Health Insurance Scheme (UHIS) is a Government of India programme
to provide health insurance cover to population below poverty line. Under this
programme any individual or a family of 5 or 7 members belonging to below poverty line
category can subscribe by paying an annual premium of Rs.365, Rs.548 and Rs.730
which Govt. of India subsidises by Rs.200, Rs.300 and Rs.400 respectively. From
2005-06, the Government of Karnataka will pay an additional subsidy of Rs.150, Rs.200 and
Rs.250 under this programme. This reduces the premium payable to Rs.15, Rs.48 and Rs.80
respectively. Initially the state government will cover 2.5 lakh SC/ST families who are members
of Stree Shakti self-help groups.
The beneficiaries of this scheme will get an insurance cover of Rs.30,000 for the whole year
for certain ailments excluding pre-existing diseases and delivery in case of expectant mothers.
United Insurance Company is the nodal implementing agency of this scheme.

assistance than districts with good indicators such
as Chikmaglur, Kodagu and Uttara Kannada. This
disparity indicates that equitable and consistent
norms for allocating funds to Zilla Panchayats
must form the basis of devolution of funds.
Despite the decreasing trend in outlays for financing
healthcare, Karnataka ranks third among major
states in its health expenditure (Table 6.27). This
suggests that overall, most states do not provide
adequately for health. A matter of concern is the
fact that Karnataka has lower health indicators
than some states that are spending less and the
question of targeting expenditure to regions/
districts and vulnerable sub-populations needs to
be seriously addressed by government.

Government health
infrastructure
Over time, Karnataka has seen considerable
expansion in health infrastructure in terms of both
trained professionals and institutions. Between
1985 and 2003, the number of primary health
centres (PHCs) increased from 365 to 1,696,
sub-centres increased from 4,964 to 8,143 and
community health centres (CHCs) from 27 to 253.
However, this expansion was not evenly distributed
across the state as is evident from the institution
and population ratio. The rural population covered
by a PHC is about 30,000 (20,000 in hilly and
tribal areas) and by a sub-centre, about 5,000
(3,000 in hilly and tribal areas). The region-wise
distribution reveals that south Karnataka has a
better ratio than either the Bombay Karnataka or
Hyderabad Karnataka regions. This is also true of
the bed–population ratio. Sub-centre population
coverage in Hyderabad Karnataka is about 32
per cent less than south Karnataka and 27 per cent
below Bombay Karnataka. The corresponding
figures in terms of the PHC population ratio are 26
per cent and 16 per cent less than south Karnataka
and Bombay Karnataka respectively. With
reference to the bed–population, infrastructure
in Bombay Karnataka region is 37 per cent and
in Hyderabad Karnataka, 30 per cent less than
southern Karnataka. The doctor–population ratio
is 1:3240 and doctor patient ratio is 1:2167
showing an improvement over 1985 (Table 6.28).
The expansion of coverage of health infrastructure

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

facilities is an important step in the provisioning of
an efficient healthcare delivery system. It should
be supported by providing adequate drugs and
equipment, maintaining institutions, and ensuring
that health personnel are accountable to the
people they serve. A more equitable distribution
of institutions is also very necessary to bridge
regional disparities in health and nutrition levels.
The bed–population ratio (public and private) is
lowest in Kerala (382) followed by Tamil Nadu
(1,120), Karnataka (1,209) and Andhra Pradesh
(2,536). There are more than 35,000 sanctioned
posts of doctors, technicians and para-medical
staff of which about 25,500 have been filled. The
government has taken steps since the early 1990s
to ensure that all vacancies in the cadre of doctors
and nurses are filled, even resorting to local
contract appointments to ensure that vacancies in
the northern and malnad districts are filled (Table
6.29). Currently about 10.5 per cent of the posts
of medical officers are vacant and districts with
a high number of vacancies are Uttara Kannada
(24 per cent), Kodagu (21 per cent), Raichur
(20.7 per cent) and Chikmaglur (20.5 per cent).
In most of the northern districts vacancies of
doctors are above the state average. Doctors and
other trained para-medical staff are reluctant to
work in north Karnataka districts like Raichur and
Gulbarga or in the malnad districts of Kodagu
and Chikmaglur, preferring the more salubrious
climate of Bangalore-Mysore. The number of
vacancies in the cadre of female health assistants
is also rather high. Coupled with absenteeism this
leads to a scenario where institutions function at
below capacity levels and are unable to fulfil local
needs. Institutional deliveries require that doctors
and nurses be available at all times to deal with
possible emergencies. Kodagu and Chikmaglur,
which have good HDIs, for instance have an IMR
above the state average, which can be partly
attributed to lack of staff.

Public–private participation
Karnataka has initiated several measures to
ensure greater community participation in the
management of healthcare. The government
has constituted Arogya Raksha Samithis in
district and taluk hospitals to oversee hospital

BOX 6.5

Round-the-clock nursing services
In a major move towards reducing infant and maternal mortality, Karnataka has decided to
provide round the-clock nursing services at the primary health centre level. This service will
ensure more institutional deliveries and improved care of newborn babies. Government has
identified 399 primary health centres in 39 most backward taluks of the state where this new
programme will be piloted.

Public–private partnership
Under the public–private initiative in the state, so far 80 primary health centres have been identified and 28
have been assigned to private medical colleges and NGOs for complete management and it is now proposed
to assign another 100 primary health centres during the current year. Under this scheme NGOs and private
medical colleges can appoint their own staff to run these centres. Internal evaluation of this arrangement has
shown that there has been considerable improvement in the management of these primary health centres.

maintenance and decide how to use the money
collected as user charges. In another innovative
step, the Health department has mobilised
the support of self-help groups (such as
Stree Shakti groups) to spread awareness about
basic healthcare and to distribute medicines for
common ailments. The management of 28 PHCs
has been transferred to NGOs and private medical
colleges and government provides 75 per cent of
the total expenditure as financial support. This
is an important step towards promoting private
participation in healthcare meant for the poor.
The management of the Rajiv Gandhi super
speciality hospital in Raichur has been entrusted
to Apollo hospitals for 10 years. The Karnataka
Health Promotion Trust is funded by the Bill Gates
Foundation for focused attention on the control of
HIV/AIDS and rehabilitation of patients.

shows that there is greater dependency on private
healthcare services rather than on government for
non-hospitalised treatment (i.e. outpatient care)
in both rural and urban areas for all southern
states and all-India. Among the southern states,
rural Kerala has the highest proportion of cases
treated in government hospitals followed by rural
Karnataka. In urban areas, however, the number of
cases treated in government healthcare facilities is
the lowest in Karnataka across all southern states
as well as all-India (Table 6.30).

Private sector and healthcare

NFHS 2 data shows that utilisation of public health
facilities and institutions for child delivery is highest
(78.2 per cent) for women with low and middle
standards of living. Utilisation of private healthcare
facilities by SCs and STs is also very low. There
cannot be a better indicator of the primacy of the
state’s healthcare systems as the most favoured
provider of healthcare for the poor.

The healthcare services provided by the private and
corporate sector are largely concentrated in urban
areas. Despite this constraint, data (NSSO survey)

Private sector healthcare is a mixed scenario, with
high-tech speciality hospitals coexisting with seedy

clinics run by quacks. The services available to the
poor and marginal groups in private health facilities
may not necessarily be superior to what public
healthcare offers but it has certain advantages for
users. Public healthcare is often associated with lack
of staff, medicines and equipment. Above all, there
is chronic absenteeism among providers and rent
seeking. Private healthcare may end up sending the
poor into debt, but its merit lies in being available
when needed. Improved governance will certainly
result in better utilisation of public health facilities
by those for whom it was designed.

Tele-medicine project
The Karnataka Tele-medicine Project is a joint venture of the Indian Space Research Organisation
(ISRO) and the Government of Karnataka to provide expert medical services to rural and remote
areas. Hospitals/health centres in remote areas are linked via INSAT satellites with super
speciality hospitals thus providing patients in rural/remote places with access to specialist
doctors for consultation and referral services.
The tele-medicine system consists of customised medical software integrated with computer
hardware, along with diagnostic instruments connected to VSAT at each location.
The project was started on a pilot basis wherein Chamarajnagar district hospital and Vivekananda
Memorial Hospital (an NGO-run rural health unit) at Saragur in H.D. Kote taluk, Mysore district
were linked with Narayana Hrudayalaya, Bangalore.

Achieving the objectives of
Vision 2020
The foregoing analysis of population, health and
nutrition provides a reasonably bright picture of
achievements. The various strategies of the state
have had a positive impact on health as reflected in
the fact that most of the health indicators are above
the all-India average. Disparities between regions,
men and women, and between social groups have
also narrowed. Although the state must now focus on
matching the performance of neighbours like Kerala,
it can be said that Karnataka is moving in the right
direction and the targeted level of achievements
in the Karnataka Vision 2020 document is likely
to be achieved if the tempo is enhanced through
increased financial outlays and sustained good
governance. Lack of adequate budgetary support
and a need to improve governance, especially at
the cutting edge are factors that impact critically on
health outcomes.

Tele-medicine is used for the following purposes:

Remote consultation;

Second opinion;

Interpretation services;

Continuing education and exchange of clinical information; and

Home care.
Karnataka’s tele-medicine project envisages linking of all district hospitals, hospitals run by trusts
as well as a few taluk level hospitals with super speciality hospitals such as Narayana Hrudayala,
Bangalore (Cardiology), Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology, Bangalore, St. John’s Medical College
hospital, Bangalore (Paediatrics), NIMHANS, Bangalore (Neurology), JSS Institute of Medical
Science, Mysore (Nephrology) and Samatvam Institute of Diabetology, Bangalore (Diabetics).
The Government is extending this project to 13 more districts and the remaining districts will be
covered in a phased manner.The government of Karnataka will provide the required personnel and
space for the project while ISRO will provide VSAT connection and equipment.



One crucial path to achieving the goals set out in
Vision 2020 lies in targeting disparities of region,
caste and gender.
 The Hyderabad Karnataka region, which
has poor health indicators compared with
other regions, is underserved in terms of
infrastructure and funding. Literacy rates
are low, the percentage of agricultural wage
labour is significantly large, and there is a
concentration of SC and ST populations.
Similarly, there are certain districts like
Bijapur in Bombay Karnataka, Chamrajnagar,
Kolar and Tumkur in south Karnataka, which
have levels of performance below their
regional average. These areas will need





strategies tailored to address the specificity
of their deficiency in health performance.
Sub-populations such as the Scheduled Castes
and Tribes have a very poor health profile
compared with the rest of the population.
Their CBR, CDR and IMR are worse than the
state average. Their utilisation of healthcare
facilities is also poor. Maximising coverage of
these vulnerable groups will have promising
outcomes.
Women should be a strong focus area
because so many health issues arise from
gender inequity and their lack of control over
their reproduction. High MMR and IMR and
insufficient nutrition point to the subordinate
and marginal status of women.
Enhancing health expenditure is critical to
improvements in healthcare services. Health

One crucial path to
achieving the goals set
out in Vision 2020 lies in
targeting disparities of
region, caste and gender.

expenditure actually declined from 1 per cent
of GSDP in 1990-91 to 0.88 per cent in
2002-03. Expenditure on rural healthcare
must be stepped up since the most vulnerable
segment of the population resides here.
Expansion in medical and tertiary education
must not occur at the expense of primary
healthcare.
Population growth will have to come down
to about 1.0 per cent per year from the
current 1.7 per cent. This can be achieved by
reducing CBR to about 16 to begin with
(the target is 13), through family planning
and reducing CDR to less than 6 through
improved health. This would stabilise the
population.
Since more than 70 per cent of total
infant deaths occur at the neonatal



stage, interventions must focus on several
strategies to prevent neonatal deaths
through encouraging spacing methods
particularly in young couples and combining
community healthcare with institutional
facilities. The causes of neonatal deaths are
both exogenous and endogenous. Many are
preventable through early detection (e.g. low
birth weight, obstructed labour, asphyxia)
and immunisation, which is why full ANC of
the target population should be 100 per cent.
Filling up all vacancies of ANMs and medical
officers, training, orientation, and supervision
are essential.
Complete immunisation among children
below two years must be achieved in spite
of substantial investment. High-risk districts
such as Raichur, also have the least coverage

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005







and achievement of targets here will ensure
universal immunisation in the state.
High rates of MMR can be best minimised by
ensuring total ANC and universal coverage
by skilled birth assistants and institutional
obstetric care for problematic cases. Here
rural areas are most in need of attention
with a high 61.5 per cent of deliveries taking
place at home. More 24-hour facilities to
deal with medical emergencies will have to
be introduced.
The magnitude of under-nutrition and iron
deficiency in Karnataka, as revealed by recent
data squarely signals that nutrition is a major
health issue in the state.The targets for 2007
include reduction of severe malnutrition
among children from 6.2 per cent to 3 per cent
and moderate malnutrition from 45 per cent
to 30 per cent, and reduction in newborn
children with low birth weight from 35
per cent to 10 per cent. This ambitious
plan requires a proper strategy to promote
low-cost, nutritious diets using locally
available food to supplement food security
through the PDS while poverty reduction
programmes add to people’s income. The
impact of the ICDS has been diluted by its
inability to target high-risk cases.
The quality of healthcare services seems
to be on the decline as reflected by the









low ANC coverage and the fact that only
50 per cent of deliveries are institutional
deliveries. Public healthcare will have to
improve quality by ensuring that all staff is
in place especially in regions/districts with
high IMR and MMR, maintaining buildings
and equipment and ensuring an adequate
supply of medicines.
Good governance in health means that service
providers will function in a transparent and
responsible manner. Absenteeism and graft
must be dealt with firmly.
Public health programmes in the state
have not yet managed to control diseases
like malaria, tuberculosis, jaundice,
gastroenteritis, and the incidence of some
of these diseases has risen in recent times.
Better sanitation and a protected source of
drinking water are critical inputs.
Data on morbidity is grossly deficient and
data on morbidity at all health facilities
should be compiled at district level.
District-wise data on MMR and IMR are not
readily available.
Gram panchayats should be involved in
managing healthcare by developing a set of
village level indicators that can be monitored
regularly. Containing HIV/AIDs will require
strenuous efforts from local bodies and
communities.

Gender and Human Development

CHAPTER 8

Gender and Human Development
Introduction
The 1999 Karnataka Human Development
Report provided a range of data and analysis
documenting widespread discrimination against
girls and women in economic, political as well
as social life. It pointed out that public policies
to change this situation had not been completely
effective because women had been viewed
primarily as homemakers, rather than as full and
equal citizens in a just society.
This chapter examines the extent to which there
has been a change in perspective in the intervening
years between the first and second Reports.
Has a new and more unified vision emerged,
that acknowledges women as empowered and
autonomous agents of social and human progress?
To what extent have the government’s policies
and programmes drawn from such a vision? How
effective have they been in empowering women
and transforming gender relations? How has
women’s position in the economy and in politics
changed? What insights does our analysis provide
for the steps to be taken from here on?

may not always be matched by a correspondingly
high GDI ranking. However, low performance
on gender indicators almost always goes
hand-in-hand with poor human development
indicators overall. Unequal gender relations,
exacerbated by disparities of income and caste, can
contribute significantly to a lowering of the overall
HDI, simply because women constitute almost half
the population. Systemic gender biases mean that,
where human development is poor, the burdens fall
disproportionately on women. When government
and other programmes for improving schooling,
nutrition, health or a range of other services such
as safe drinking water, sanitation, housing, do not
reach people effectively, this lack of reach affects
women and girls most adversely. Latent gender
biases within families, communities and service
providers themselves mean that women, who are
most in need of public services, are often excluded
from their purview. In Karnataka, as in many
states, gender disparities are also linked to regional
disparities in human development.
BOX 8.1

In looking at human development from a gendered
perspective, three questions will be addressed
initially: (i) In what ways is human development
linked to gender discrimination in particular? (ii) Is
poverty congruent with poor human development
for women? (iii) How do we understand the
concept of ‘empowerment’?

What is gender analysis?

Gender as a lens for human
development

Gender analysis is a process that assesses the differential impact of proposed and/or existing
policies, programmes and legislation on women and men. It makes it possible for policy to
be undertaken with an appreciation of gender differences, of the nature of relationships
between women and men and of their different social realities, life expectations and economic
circumstances. It is a tool for understanding social processes and for responding with informed
and equitable options.

The place of gender analysis in policies and
programmes that are intended to balance the
pressures for economic growth with the needs of
human development has been recognised, almost
from the inception of the U.N. Human Development
Reports. The development of specific indices such
as the gender development index (GDI) and the
gender empowerment measure (GEM) mark this
recognition. It is well known that a high HDI ranking

‘Sex’ identifies the biological differences between women and men. ‘Gender’ is the culturally
specific set of characteristics that identifies the social behaviour of women and men and the
relationship between them. Gender, therefore, refers not simply to women or men, but to the
relationship between them, and the way it is socially constructed. Because it is a relational term,
gender must include women and men. Like the concepts of class, race and ethnicity, gender is an
analytical tool for understanding social processes.

It compares how and why women and men are affected by policy issues. Gender analysis
challenges the assumption that everyone is affected by policies, programmes and legislation in
the same way regardless of gender, a notion often referred to as ‘gender-neutral policy’.

Gender and Human Development

Despite the strong
correlation between poor
human development
indicators and gender
disparity, there are
other kinds of gender
discrimination, which,
perversely, are worse in
places where traditional
human development
indicators are good.
Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the
aversion to daughters,
known otherwise as ‘son
preference’.

Table 8.1 reveals the sharp distinctions among the
districts and the regions of the state overall. While
the districts of south Karnataka are generally at
the top of the composite index (with the exception
of Davangere), followed by the districts of Bombay
Karnataka, the districts of Hyderabad Karnataka
are near the bottom of the composite index.These
district-and region-wise indicators are forerunners
of a scenario that is played out along a range of
other dimensions having to do with work and
income as well.1

Is gender congruent with poverty?
Despite the strong correlation between poor human
development indicators and gender disparity,
there are other kinds of gender discrimination,
which, perversely, are worse in places where
traditional human development indicators are
good. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the
aversion to daughters, known otherwise as ‘son
preference’. The intensity of such forms of gender
discrimination, as evidenced by worsening sex
ratios, oddly enough, is not correlated with poor
human development indicators. Violence against
women is not always associated with regions of low
economic growth and poor human development
indicators. These phenomena suggest that gender
violence is assuming new forms as the economy
grows. An improvement in human development,
which does not always mean a commensurate
improvement in all forms of gender equity, can
scarcely be regarded as a process that truly
enlarges people’s choices.

Empowerment
‘Empowerment’ has emerged as a key concept in
policy discussions on gender over the last decade
and a half. The concept, in recent times, has
become so elastic that it has lost the dimensions,

1
An important caveat at the start of this discussion is the major
changes in the delineation of district boundaries. In 1989,
Bangalore Rural district was split from Bangalore. In 1997,
Bagalkot district was split from Bijapur, Chamarajnagar district
from Mysore, Gadag district from Dharwad, Haveri district from
Dharwad, Koppal district from Raichur, Udupi district from
Dakshina Kannada; and Davangere district was created from
parts of Bellary, Chitradurga and Shimoga. This carving out of
new districts has meant that our analysis of changes over time
has been limited to using those sources that provide comparable
district-wise figures.

172

which originally gave it strength and shape.
Empowerment, conceptually, has certain key
components: (i) it radically shifted from the old
top–down ‘welfare’ approach of treating women
as a disadvantaged group in need of handouts,
towards a recognition of the structural roots of
gender bias; (ii) it addressed the issue of power
and powerlessness that goes with gender and
other forms of inequality; (iii) most significant is
the recognition that a change in power relations
requires not only a change in control over external
resources such as land and income but also a
change in the person’s sense of self-worth and
confidence; (iv) it emphasised the importance of
group processes and solidarity as a way of breaking
the cycle of hopelessness and helplessness that
unequal gender relations perpetuate.
As has happened with many other concepts,
‘empowerment’ has been so overused and
misused that it has lost its core meaning. One
often finds a programme being described as a
programme for women’s empowerment without
any clarity as to how it will actually change
existing power relations. Rescuing the concept of
empowerment so that it can have more analytical
content for policies requires us to examine
whether there has, in actual fact, been a change in
mindsets, i.e. a paradigm shift away from the old
‘welfare’ approach and whether there has been a
corresponding change in policies and institutions
supported by a key ingredient of systemic change,
namely investment or is it ‘business as usual’, with
some tinkering? Some of these issues (financing
and gender audit) are addressed in chapter 3,
Part III.

Human development: Gender
dimensions and differentials
For any patriarchal society to move towards
greater gender equality, as part of a process of
human development, requires change at many
levels – in values and norms, in structures and
institutions, and in behaviour and practices. This
can happen if women are empowered in economic,
political and socio-cultural terms. They need more
access to resources, greater political voice and
social transformations that lead to their exercising
greater agency and autonomy in the decisions

What is empowerment?
The question is both complex and complicated. Women members of self-help groups financed
under two government programmes gave a variety of answers to this question.They offer several
definitions all of which may justifiably be described as facets of a process of empowerment. In
the context of the SHG programme, and in the larger context of poverty, women put the ability
to improve their economic status on top followed by an improvement in their status in their
families in terms of both greater respect and, more concretely, enhanced participation in family
decision-making. If gender justice comes low on the priority list then clearly the programme
must do more by way of conscientisation.

that affect their own lives and society in general.
However, focusing on women alone cannot make
such changes happen. Such transformations in
consciousness take time and require open public
debate and discussion, and efforts through the
educational system, and through communications
and the media. Men must change their entrenched
patriarchal discourse in favour of one that is
inclusive and gender-friendly.
The role of the state lies in preventing harm and
protecting girls and women on the one hand,
and promoting women’s empowerment, gender
equality and male transformation on the other. In
order to play this role effectively, the state must
do at least four things: support changes in social
norms and practices; promote key legal/political
changes; create strong institutions at multiple
levels from the village to the highest levels; and
provide resources and make investments. How the
state brings about changes in gender relations,
and with what strategic vision during a period of
significant socio-economic change brought on by
economic liberalisation, will provide the touchstone
for whether any real movement towards gender
equality will occur in the coming decade.

The following sections analyse some of the
macro-trends in the available data on key elements
of gender dimensions and differentials in order to
explicate critical changes in the environment for
state action. Of the three elements that constitute
the Human Development Index, education and
healthcare and the ways they impact gender are
explored in chapters 5 and 6 respectively, hence,
this chapter will analyse the third component,
work and income. To this, two additional sets of
indicators have been added – the sex ratio, and
women’s autonomy. The focus is on highlighting
differentials wherever possible, in order to point
to the varying life experiences of women and
men, and the skewed life chances that young girls
face.

Work participation and worker
distribution: Feminisation of poverty
Work participation provides key insights into the
core issues of women’s economic dependence and
their ability to control incomes and expenditures,
exercise some degree of personal autonomy and
share in decision-making.
While examining the work participation data from
1991 to 2001 it must be borne in mind that the
1990s were a period of significant growth in new
industries in Karnataka, fuelled by, but not limited
to, the boom in the information technology sector.
The assumption is that work participation, the
share of workers who are main workers, and the
number, which is not dependent on agriculture,
would increase during the period.
Table 8.2 shows that except Kerala, the work
participation rates (WPR) for both men and
women in Karnataka were similar to the other
southern states in 2001. There was only a small
increase (2.5 percentage points) over 1991 in
WPR for women and men.
Table 8.3 reveals that WPR for men increased
by 4.7 per cent while for women it went up by
8.8 per cent. This increase in WPR was not evenly
distributed. Barring Davangere and Chikmaglur
that showed negative rates of change for women,
the remaining districts of south Karnataka saw
significant increases in female WPR.

Male-female differences in WPR continued
with only a marginal change in the differential.
What is interesting is that the male WPRs are
less widely dispersed across the districts than
the corresponding female rates. For example,
Bombay Karnataka, with an average increase
for women of 6.4 per cent, included both
-10.7 per cent for Bijapur and +14.4 per cent
for Dharwad. It is clear that the rates of change
in WPR for women are much more widely
dispersed across the districts and regions. This
probably points to greater volatility in both
the demand and supply of female labour, as
also their marginal character. If women’s work
participation is more marginal, then the rates are
likely to be more variable over time and across
space as well.
Turning to the distribution between main and
marginal workers,Table 8.4 shows that Karnataka
in 2001 had the highest percentage of marginal
workers among women (34.12 per cent), and the
lowest percentage of marginal workers among
men (8.79 per cent) in the four southern states.
Between 1991 and 2001, the share of main
workers has declined for both men and women
and while the share of marginal workers has
gone up for men (by 7.75 percentage points);
the increase is even more significant for women
(11.47 percentage points).

However, while the percentage for men is still
under 10 per cent of the total, the percentage for
women has increased from less than one-fourth
to over one-third. The percentage point increases
are also much higher for women. Most striking
is the fact that in the districts of Hyderabad
Karnataka, the share of marginal workers among
women went from 14 per cent to an astonishing
39 per cent. Bombay Karnataka districts also saw
a significant increase in the proportion of marginal
workers among women.
Analysing the data on work participation along
with the findings on main versus marginal
workers presents a disturbing picture of the
geographical context of female poverty. Work
participation rates either fell or were stagnant
in the Hyderabad Karnataka region and saw
modest increases in the Bombay Karnataka
region. The share of marginal workers (male
and female) has also shown the most dramatic
increase in Hyderabad Karnataka, followed by
Bombay Karnataka. And the outcomes of this
development are much worse for women. An
examination of the data on the distribution of
workers by category further substantiates this
downward trend for women and work.

Between 1991 and 2001,
the share of main workers
has declined for both men
and women and while the
share of marginal workers
has gone up for men (by
7.75 percentage points);
the increase is even more
significant for women
(11.47 percentage points).

household industry and other workers in
Karnataka is nearer the all-India average than the
other southern states. However, a closer analysis
of the data on the distribution of workers by
category reveals even more disturbing trends for
women’s work. Between 1991 and 2001, while
male dependence on agricultural work, either as
cultivators or as labourers, declined sharply from
58 to 49 per cent, their share of the category ‘other
workers’ which includes work in industry and the
service sectors went up from 40 to 48 per cent.
The scenario has been reversed for women. True,
their presence in the agriculture sector is much
more visible: the percentage of women cultivators
went up by 4.82 per cent but, unfortunately,
the percentage of women agricultural labourers
also showed an upward trend by 5.02 per cent.
Women’s share in the category ‘other workers’
fell precipitously by 14.9 per cent. However,
their share in household industry registered an
increase.
The district and region-wise picture for the
distribution of workers across categories is
presented in Table 8.6. Female dependence on
agriculture is higher than male, across all districts
and it is particularly high in north Karnataka.
The maximum number of female household
industry workers is found in two districts,
Dakshina Kannada (46.15 per cent) and Udupi
(26.12 per cent) primarily due to beedi and
agarbathi that are home-based activities.
Although the percentage of female ‘other workers’
is only half of the male work force, Bangalore
Urban district has a fairly equitable distribution of
male and female workers followed by Kodagu.The
percentage of female ‘other workers’ is the highest
in Haveri (46.16 per cent) in north Karnataka.
Overall, the decade has not been favourable to poor
women.The trends point, instead, to a feminisation
of poverty which is an all-India phenomenon
and not unique to Karnataka. The increasing
casualisation of female labour represented by
the increase in the number of women marginal
workers suggests that the economy is unable to
generate full time employment for women. Their
increasing dependence on agriculture and, more
specifically, on agricultural labour, coupled with

a declining presence in the category of ‘other
workers’ is directly related to a reverse trend in
the male work force. It could mean that men are
migrating from the rural sector due to various
factors or that the informal sector has grown
faster than the agricultural sector. It could have
been an opportunity for women, but the sad
reality is that women get jobs traditionally held

by men only when men leave those jobs, because
they have ceased to be remunerative. And once
jobs held by women become remunerative, then
men take over. Overall, the fruits of the state’s
economic boom of the 1990s do not appear to
have trickled down to the northern districts and
it has not benefited women workers, especially
those from the poorer regions. The last piece of

corroborating evidence regarding the feminisation
of poverty is from the data on differentials and
trends in agricultural wages.

In both absolute and
relative terms, the
female-male wage
gap went up sharply,
providing one more
reason to conclude that
female workers have
fared worse than their
male counterparts during
the decade.

As public healthcare
for women and girls
improved, the female
sex ratio also registered
a modest improvement.
Unfortunately, a new
and ugly form of sex
discrimination has now
become visible – one that
is strongly correlated with
prosperity and daughter
aversion.

As in the rest of the country, male wages are higher
than female wages. This is one manifestation of
gender discrimination that refuses to disappear,
arising as it does, from an inequitable gender
division of labour. Agricultural wages also show
the same range – a fact that has significant
implications, considering that agricultural labourers
are, typically, among the poorest and have high
proportions of Dalit and tribal population. Table
8.7 shows that the absolute difference between
male and female wages increased from Rs.4.57
in 1991 to Rs.18.92 in 2001. As a percentage
of the female agricultural wage rate, the gap
went up from 33.75 per cent to 53.83 per cent.
In both absolute and relative terms, the
female–male wage gap went up sharply, providing
one more reason to conclude that female workers
have fared worse than their male counterparts
during the decade. The difference was particularly
stark in Bidar, Gulbarga and Koppal districts
with male agricultural wages being more than
double the female wage. Districts with the least
differences in male-female wages are Haveri,
Gadag and Shimoga.

Sex ratio
The sex ratio in Karnataka started in 1901 as the
lowest among the southern states, and the gap
has increased by 2001, in relation to both Kerala
and Andhra Pradesh, although not Tamil Nadu
(Table 8.8). Between 1991 and 2001, the ratio
improved marginally in all four states. However,
the southern states have performed well overall.
Haryana has the lowest sex ratio (861) in the
country and Kerala the highest (1,058). There
were only four districts in the state in which the
sex ratio improved over the course of the century
(Table 8.9). Ten districts are below the state norm
and of these, Bangalore Urban district, which ranks
first in the district HDI, has the dubious distinction
of coming last with a female sex ratio of 906,
comparable to Nagaland (909). Udupi (1,127),
Dakshina Kannada (1,023) and Hassan (1,005)
compare favourably with Kerala, although Udupi,
unfortunately, has regressed from 1,134 in 1991.

In the four districts (Shimoga, Uttara Kannada,
Chikmaglur and Kodagu) where the sex ratio
improved over the course of the century, the ratio
was still significantly below average at the start
of the century. The bulk of the decline for most
districts occurred in the period between 1901 and
1981, i.e. prior to the period when sex selection
began to be practised in a significant way.
These declines in the female sex ratio undoubtedly
were caused by poor reproductive healthcare and
gender biases, which ensured that women and
girls did not have access to adequate nutrition and
healthcare. Hence, as public healthcare for women
and girls improved, the female sex ratio also
registered a modest improvement. Unfortunately,
a new and ugly form of sex discrimination has now
become visible – one that is strongly correlated
with prosperity and daughter aversion.

Child sex ratio
The child sex ratio (CSR) signals the onset of a
scary scenario where women could vanish and
society would have just one gender. At the
all-India level, the CSR in 1991 was 945 and
regressed to 927 in 2001. The sharpest decline
was noticed in the economically developed
states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat,
Uttaranchal, Punjab, Maharashtra and the Union
Territory of Chandigarh. All three southern
states other than Kerala also experienced
a significant decline (Table 8.10), although
lower than the all-India figure. This alarming
trend has its roots in the Indian aversion to
daughters and preference for sons, a notion
that has strong economic and cultural roots. A
son is viewed as an economic asset whereas a
daughter is insensitively perceived as a drain
on the family’s resources. When this perception
interconnects with the low status that society
and culture traditionally accord women, then
some sections of society conclude that modern
technology, through pre-birth sex selection and
female foeticide, offers the ‘perfect’ solution to
reducing the female population. An overview of
region-wise and district-wise differences
is presented in Table 8.11. The Hyderabad
Karnataka and Bombay Karnataka regions, to a
lesser extent, experienced smaller improvements

High education levels do

in the overall sex ratio between 1991 and 2001
than south Karnataka. However, the extent
of the decline in the child sex ratio (with the
exception of Belgaum and Gulbarga districts)
is also lower in the two poorer regions than in
south Karnataka. The district with the highest
decline in CSR is Mandya, which is a relatively
high-income district. Here, unwillingness to
fragment property through either inheritance or
dowry has led to a desire for one or two children,
preferably only sons. It is unfortunate that
Dakshina Kannada has also registered a decline
in CSR. Some districts show an improvement
and, except Kodagu, these districts do not have
high levels of literacy or economic development.
Hence, high education levels do not necessarily
translate into gender sensitivity. High incomes
mean that people have access to, and can afford
to pay for, the technology for sex selection. The
skewed child sex ratio is a manifestation of a
covert form of gender violence with enormous
social implications. As regions experience
economic growth and poverty reduction, as long
as gender bias persists and is reflected in the
spread and increase of dowry and other practices,
the possibility of more people undertaking sex
selection also increases. Without systematic
efforts to address this problem, increases
in economic growth, consumerism, and
improvements in health and education may
well translate into stronger daughter aversion.
The stakeholders are many: parents, husbands,
doctors, nurses, and the manufacturers of
equipment used for sex selection who aggressively
market the latest technology. Women also opt
for sex selection for a variety of reasons such

as domestic violence, harassment and lack of
awareness. Enforcement of laws prohibiting
the use of technology for sex selection and
awareness building by government, NGOs and
activist groups can reduce the growth of this
heinous practice.
With the exception of only 8 out of 27 districts,
the child sex ratio is worse in urban than in rural
areas (Table 8.12).

Women’s autonomy
Along three dimensions, household decisions,
freedom of movement, and access to money,
the picture for women in Karnataka relative to
the rest of India is mixed. Women in Karnataka
have greater physical mobility and access to
money, but less say in decisions about their
own healthcare and other household decisions
(Table 8.13).

Violence against women
The UN Declaration on the Elimination of
Violence against Women (1993) defines ‘violence
against women’ as any act of gender-based
violence that results in, or is likely to result in
physical, sexual or mental harm and suffering
to women whether occurring in public or private
life. This definition encapsulates a wide range
of offences ranging from dowry deaths, spousal
abuse, rape, trafficking in women, sexual
harassment, sex selection etc. Bringing ‘domestic’
violence within the domain of violence against
women means that what was traditionally
hidden as a ‘family’ or ‘personal’ matter such as
wife battering or dowry-related harassment is

now an offence on par with violence perpetrated
against women in the public domain. Violence
against women has its roots in men’s economic
and social domination and their control of
female sexuality and reproduction. It is also
an instrument in the domination and control of
the poor by upper castes. Human development
cannot occur in an environment that is vitiated
by violence. Women, who are caught up in an
environment of violence, or even the threat of

violence, find it constrains their mobility, their
autonomy and sense of self.
The incidence of physical abuse of women in
Karnataka is 21.5 per cent, which is slightly higher
than the all-India average. Women in the southern
states, except Kerala, receive the same degree of
mistreatment as their sisters in the rest of the
country. However, women in Karnataka receive
less physical mistreatment than their counterparts

in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh – if this can
count as a positive trend (Table 8.14).
Data on crimes against women (Table 8.15)
indicates there is little correlation between the
number of registered crimes in police records
and the widespread nature of violence against
women across social institutions. The fact that
crimes against women are under-represented in
official records points to the difficulties women
experience in reporting crimes and the resistance
of public authorities to taking legal cognisance of
offences against women. However, one category
of crimes i.e. a category of deaths exclusively of
women – mainly young, newly married women

– has emerged in the public consciousness due to
the efforts of women’s groups and NGOs. In police
records, they are classified under three specific
categories, which invoke different sections of the
law. These are ‘dowry murders’ (committed by the
woman's husband or members of his family for
additional dowry or non-payment of promised
dowry); ‘suicides’ (forced or voluntary, but in most
cases related to dowry demands); and ‘accidents’
(a majority classified under ‘stove burst’ or ‘kitchen
accident’). Deaths under these three categories
add up to an alarming figure (Vimochana, 1999).
Also, in the early phase of the study, as it collated
police statistics,Vimochana, an NGO, noted a major
anomaly between its figures and those of the police.

It found that a large number of deaths were being
classified in police records as ‘accidents’ under ‘UDR’
(Unnatural Death Register). The category of ‘dowry
deaths’ in a technical sense only included those
cases that had been booked by the police under
the relevant sections of the law.The ‘accident’ cases
that were closed for want of evidence, however,
were largely due to ‘stove bursts’ or ‘kitchen
accidents’. Investigations revealed that a large
number of murders and suicides, punishable under
law, were being made to look like ‘accidents’ by the
husband and/or members of his family.These cases
were closed by the investigating police officers for
want of hard evidence of a crime. In Bangalore city
alone, 1,133 women died in murders, suicides and
accidents in 1997, 1,248 in 1998, and 618 till
mid-July 1999 (Menon, 1999).

on cruelty by husband and relatives of husband
(Section 498-A IPC), (Table 8.15), it is more than
evident that for large numbers of married women,
the right to live in safety, even within their own
homes (ironically, the one place an individual
expects to feel secure), and in a climate free from
intimidation and violence, is not available. Thirty
per cent of all crimes against women in 2003
were registered under these sections. Another 29
per cent constitute rape and molestation cases an
indicator of the threat women face to their bodily
integrity within and outside the home.

The stagnation in women’s work participation
in the poorer districts, the narrowing of their
work and income opportunities, growing wage
differentials between men and women and the
huge and apparently increasing disparities among
the higher and lower income regions of the state,
when combined with rising aspirations as reflected
in women’s growing educational involvement,
pose a major challenge to the policies, strategies
and programmes of the government.
During the last decade, state actions to support
women have occurred, both through and
outside the Department of Women and Child

186

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

Development (DWCD). Major strategies outside
DWCD include the allotment and provision
of housing title deeds (hakku patras) for
women only under government sponsored, low
income-housing programmes and a 30 per cent
job reservation for women in all direct recruitments
by the government and PSUs after 1996. Over
8,00,000 women are now sole home-owners
under the government financed Ashraya and
Ambedkar housing programmes. In a patriarchal
society, few women own or inherit assets such as
land and houses, hence the government’s policy,
which has enabled a large class of poor women to
become homeowners, is truly remarkable. About 50
per cent are Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
women. With reference to recruitment, out of the
45,018 sanctioned posts in 85 departments and
72 Boards and Corporations, 13,204 posts have
been reserved for women and the quota has been
slightly over-fulfilled, which is commendable.
In the next section, we will look at policy
approaches to strengthening women’s economic
capabilities and political participation, as well as
addressing violence against women.

Enabling economic development
Four broad features distinguish the approach
taken by the state government during the last
decade or so to strengthen women’s access to
income and economic resources. These include
(i) a strong emphasis on the self-help group
(SHG) model; (ii) a clear focus on poor, Dalit and
tribal women as those most in need, along with
women with disabilities or victims of violence;
(iii) a recognition that women in the districts of
Hyderabad Karnataka and Bombay Karnataka
need special attention; and (iv) the use of the
language of empowerment.

Gender and Human Development

It is undeniable that
schemes that attack
poverty, through credit
to women, augment the
income of the household,
impacting household
consumption directly.
But how far do these
interventions go in
altering intra-household
power dynamics – roles,
dependencies, and
authority?

and (iv) women from families with alcoholics, drug
addicts or physically disabled persons. As of March
2004, DWCD has formed 1,00,000 groups with a
total of 14,79,794 members, of whom 3,10,358 are
Scheduled Castes, 1,18,359 are Scheduled Tribes,
and 99,779 are from the minority communities.
The DWCD is also responsible for Swayam Sidha, a
centrally sponsored scheme (formerly Indira Mahila
Yojana) to form SHGs through the facilitation of the
anganwadi workers. The Karnataka State Women’s
Development Corporation (KSWDC) promotes
income generation, giving priority to single women
and households eligible for Swarna Jayanthi Shahari
Rozgar Yojana loans. KSWDC provides support by
identifying entrepreneurs, providing technical help to
identify viable projects, facilitating credit, promoting
marketing, training, and strengthening women’s
cooperatives.The KSWDC is responsible for different
state sponsored schemes such as Udyogini (for
credit to women entrepreneurs), the urban
Stree Shakti scheme, and a devadasi rehabilitation
programme (economic and social programmes in
nine northern districts). In addition, KSWDC has
also run the World Bank-IFAD sponsored Swashakti
scheme to form SHGs through NGOs in 7 districts
– Kolar, Tumkur, Chitradurga, Bellary, Koppal,
Raichur and Gulbarga. Thirty-six NGOs have been
contracted to work in 979 project villages, and
have formed 2,100 SHGs with 38,508 members.
Almost 50 per cent of these women are illiterate,
60 per cent are landless or have less than one acre,
and about 59 per cent are SC/STs.
It is clear that the current approaches seek to link
gender with poverty, using development delivery
as a platform for targeting women as beneficiaries
and mobilising them for social empowerment.
Swashakti, for instance, conceives of the self-help
group strategy as a means to build women’s ‘self
reliance and self confidence, to provide greater
access to and control over resources, sensitise
and strengthen the institutional capacity of
support agencies to proactively address women’s
needs, increase incomes of poor women through
involvement in income-generating activities,
develop linkages between SHGs and lending
institutions to ensure access to credit financing,
and improve access to better healthcare,
education and drudgery reduction facilities. ’ This

188

is also true for micro-enterprise-oriented schemes
like Mane Belaku and Udyogini. Similarly, a
regional emphasis is discernible in programmes
like Swashakti that unequivocally target
backward districts. An explicit strategy underlying
programme delivery is the promotion of linkages.
Stree Shakti has established convergence with the
SGSY of the Rural Development and Panchayat
Raj department, the National Backward Class
Development Corporation, the department of
Animal Husbandry, and the Ashraya and Ambedkar
housing schemes. (For an analysis of Stree Shakti
and Swashakti groups, see Box 8.5).
It is undeniable that schemes that attack poverty,
through credit to women, augment the income of
the household, impacting household consumption
directly. But how far do these interventions go in
altering intra-household power dynamics – roles,
dependencies, and authority? The evaluation of
Udyogini and Mane Belaku throws up interesting
insights. The income from the activity pursued
from the Mane Belaku loan has been spent on food
expenses of the household in 70 per cent of cases,
implying the direct relevance of these to household
consumption. But the loan and subsidy have not
always contributed to supporting or building the
entrepreneurial potential of women. In many cases,
the money is channelled to an existing enterprise
run by the men of the household. While this may
bode well for the woman’s value to the household,
it falls short of the goal of women’s economic
empowerment. The survey (DES: 2004B) of
Stree Shakti and Swashakti groups however
reveals that about 45 per cent of the loans were
taken for economic activities and the remaining for
house construction, festivals/functions, healthcare
and children’s education.
In other instances, the mobilisation of women
into SHGs for micro-credit has also led to their
social empowerment. Stree Shakti groups as also
other SHGs have demonstrated their capacities
to use women’s agency in tackling gender
issues by protesting against arrack, gutka, child
marriage and other social issues. The domain
of the home however, remains an impregnable
bastion and poor women who may acquire an
ability to contest gender issues in the public

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

domain may still be unable to take up issues
of domestic violence. Studies have documented
how sangha women from Mahila Samakhya (a
GoI programme) sometimes endure violence
because they participate in sangha activities
(Krishnamurthy and Dave 2000). However, this
in itself must not be construed as a measure of
failure of an empowerment approach; rather, it
connotes the ways in which relations of power
are sought to be renegotiated, and the tradeoffs
involved in doing so. In another context, the
majority of the women surveyed in the DES
2004 survey said they did not meet with
resistance from either the spouse or family when
they participated in group meetings, visited the
bank or attended training. About one-fourth
actually saw a significant reduction in familybased violence after they joined the SHG.
Additionally, building the capacities of poor
women to understand markets, mobilising
them into groups, federating these groups so
women can more effectively deal with other
actors in the market, creation of new innovative
financial instruments, and provision of marketing
infrastructure are the most important components
needed to facilitate access to markets of the poor
and of women (Purushothaman, M.S. Subhas and
Nagrecha, 2004).

Addressing violence against women
Studies by the National Law School of India
(Centre for Women and Law, National Law
School of India University, 1999) and Hengasara
Hakkina Sangha (HHS), an NGO in Karnataka,
(Rao et al., 1999) point to the weakness of the
formal justice system in redressing violence
against women. NGOs like Vimochana have held
public hearings to bring to light the severity of
the problem of ‘dowry deaths’.The low conviction
rate of perpetrators of crimes against women
reveals the need to improve various aspects of
the criminal justice system.
Women, who are victims of various atrocities
such as dowry, rape, sexual harassment, domestic
violence, etc. are subjected to physical and mental
torture besides having to face social and financial
problems. DWCD’s Santhwana (2001-02)

scheme provides legal assistance, financial
relief, temporary shelter, and protection to such
victims, and helps them to become self-reliant
by providing training. The Santhwana centres
are run through NGOs, with preference given to
NGOs that are running short-stay homes. Family
Counselling Centres are actively working in the
field of women’s welfare. Santhwana is being
implemented in all the 27 district headquarters
and 18 selected taluks. There are 46 Santhwana
centres in the state. The assistance provided to
these women ranges from immediate relief, to
rehabilitation. Services include toll-free women’s
help line, short-stay homes, counselling services,
legal assistance; as well as space in working
women’s hostels, financial assistance, and
training for income generation. A review of the 19
Santhwana centres run through Mahila Samakhya
Karnataka (Mathrani 2004) points out that the
scheme has failed to make real choices available
to women in need. Opting out of violent situations
translates into various needs – referral services,
legal help, medical help, livelihood/vocational
help, temporary stay, and child care to name a
few. The Santhwana centres are so under-funded
as to be only partially effective.

Opting out of violent
situations translates into

services, legal help,

vocational help,
temporary stay, and child
care to name a few.

However, poor funding is not the only concern.
While government initiatives including
Santhwana, all women police stations (AWPS),
and family counselling cells have attempted to
address gender-based crimes including domestic
violence, rape, sexual abuse, and dowry
harassment, efforts are severely constrained
by several factors in addition to the fact that
funds are short and real choices are seldom
made available to women. A research study
undertaken to study responses to domestic
violence in Gujarat and Karnataka (SNDT
Women’s University 1999) covered case studies
of AWPS. The findings reveal poor quality
services and low rates of utilisation. Reasons
include the long distances that women have to
travel to reach the stations, and an emphasis on
family reconciliation, regardless of the severity of
the case. Sometimes even female officers often
perceive domestic violence as a ‘private’ matter
and ignore prescribed investigative procedures.
The research by HHS found that counsellors in
189

Gender and Human Development

family counselling cells typically do not get the
required capacity building to offer meaningful
support and solutions to victims; instead, many
continue to emphasise the primacy of the
family over the survival needs of the woman.
The fundamental problem is that of lack of real
options to marriage, hence, the emphasis is often
on ‘saving the family’, even though that may not
be in the interest of the woman victim since the
family is the source of the problem.

The reservation for
women in local bodies
and the increased
presence of women
in public life and in
leadership roles has
reshaped gender roles.

There is a need for interventions that can offer
more meaningful options to women who seek
help. Vocational training options need to be
increased, especially since most of the traditional
ones – embroidery, tailoring, doll making, etc.
– do not provide the economic independence
required to meet women’s livelihood needs.
For women victims of violence, shelters and
short-stay homes that can provide child care
assistance, training, comprehensive counselling
and assistance for housing and employment are
vital.

Political participation at the grassroots
The representation of elected women
representatives (EWRs) in the panchayat tiers
is the highest in Karnataka as compared to the
rest of the country (Table 8.17). Women occupy
one-third of the decision-making positions in all
three tiers (Table 8.18).
The presence of a critical mass of women in
the political sphere changes the way society
perceives women (from homemaker to leader).
Second, as women in Panchayat Raj Institutions
(PRIs) reduce their political dependence on male
patrons and are backed by women’s groups at
the grassroots, a gradual shift towards a politics
based on women’s constituency emerges. The
reservation for women in local bodies and the
increased presence of women in public life and
in leadership roles has reshaped gender roles.
Shifts in gender roles within the households of
EWRs, as well as the interactions of EWRs with
government and other agencies are important
components in this transformation. A study of
women in local self-governance in Karnataka
(Stephen and Raja Sekaran 2001), notes that

190

35.6 per cent of women EWRs achieved a
moderate level of economic empowerment
after becoming gram panchayat members while
there was a distinct increase in the level of self
confidence in almost 97 per cent. According to
them, being gram panchayat (GP) members
had a positive impact on their personal abilities
such as communication skills and the capacity to
get things done. Their fear of contacting officials
and interacting with other villagers diminished.
At the community level, 31.5 per cent showed
a high degree of transformation. These women
gained the confidence to participate in public
functions, take up social issues like alcoholism
and work for improvement of their villages.
Their level of political awareness and knowledge
about programmes also increased. Research
studies also indicate that at least some EWRs do
grow into assuming leadership roles within the
community that challenge traditional patriarchal
leadership constructs. Changing role definitions
even triggers a process of ‘a redefinition and
engendering of leadership notions’, which is
‘radically different from the traditional view of
leaders being charismatic public speakers and
being overtly strong’ (Purushothaman, Anil
Kumar, and Purohit, 1999). Changes in gender
role perceptions also seem to be gradually getting
institutionalised. While field level government
officials with whom the EWRs interact often
resent having to deal with women, it has been
observed that over time, such interactions gender
sensitise government machinery at the field level
(Jain, 2001).
Several first-term women are either proxies
for male relatives and/or entrenched political
powers. Under these circumstances, it is natural
that most EWRs only represent the existing
dominant power structures, and not the interests
of women as a political constituency. In fact, most
first term EWRs are so apologetic about their
newly acquired position that they go out of the
way to insist that they owe their positions to their
male relatives, or some powerful groups in the
community. Such ‘humility’ can be understood as
a typical response when women assume a public
role not sanctioned by prevailing gender and
caste norms. Additionally, EWRs, like their sisters

elsewhere, often have to face harassment, verbal
and physical. Women activists are often concerned
about a lack of gender sensitivity among EWRs
who represent known dominant concerns of the
caste/community and do not seem to show any
extra ordinary concern in this phase for specific
gender-related issues.
The fact that initially new EWRs strongly identify
and align with and represent dominant concerns,
and adopt postures that do not challenge
entrenched power structures can be attributed in
part to an attempt to negotiate their transition into
new situations and roles. Interviews with EWRs
also highlight women’s growing enchantment
with newly acquired positions of power: ‘True

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

we came through our men the first time and are
often proxies for them, but we now know what
it is about and will come on our own the next
time’ (Singamma Sreenivasan Foundation,
2003).
A different scenario awaited second-term EWRs.
This time the government and NGOs were geared
and ready for them with training in the functioning
of the PRIs, education, health, environment,
greater gender sensitisation and legal literacy.
Capacity building initiatives have strengthened
EWRs’ ability to come into their own, as political
persons. Training has been an important aid in
enabling women to build confidence and move
towards greater independence. The government
has taken a lead in providing training and
communication support to elected women
members of Panchayat Raj institutions through
a range of methods – satellite-based training
programme, district level training programme
through departmental functionaries and NGOs,
and the distribution of hand books and video
cassettes on the Panchayat Raj Act.
The greatest opportunity in the emergence of
EWRs in such large numbers, however, lies in the
development of women as a political constituency,
and in the EWRs orienting themselves to this
constituency. However, even at its best, this
political axis based on gender, will only work in
relation to the dominant axes of caste and political
groupings.

Women’s activism, therefore, has developed new
forms in the new institutional space of PRIs.
Networking among EWRs and the formation of
federations has enabled greater effectiveness,
and provided a platform for sharing information,
strategies and experiences. Known as ‘okkutta’
these panchayat women's associations in
Karnataka are becoming pressure groups for
joint action for women’s empowerment where
earlier individual EWRs had found themselves
unable to make a dent. This phenomenon has
been accompanied by the growing spread
of women’s self-help groups and sanghas
supported by government/donor programmes.
These community based organisations (CBOs)
are emerging as key nodes of women’s
empowerment in rural Karnataka. SHGs or
sanghas are important breeding grounds for
effective EWRs. Many sanghas are supporting
and even putting up candidates for PRIs, as is
borne out in the experience of Mahila Samakhya,
Karnataka. Surely, these candidates, unlike those
propped up by male relatives, will have their
political constituency specifically among women.
Supported through training, and federated for
strength and reach, these EWRs oriented to the
women’s constituency could lead to real political
empowerment of women in rural Karnataka.
Conversely, active EWRs have also been setting
up women’s sanghas in their villages, taking
further the process of social, economic and
political empowerment of women.

Women’s activism has
developed new forms
in the new institutional
space of PRIs.

The Karnataka Women’s Information and Resource Centre Project
The Karnataka Women’s Information and Resource Centre – an NGO project- has set up federations of EWRs
in 6 districts of Karnataka – Bellary, Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Koppal and Raichur. The purpose is to use the
federations as:
• A support system for EWRs that would facilitate learning through mutual sharing;
• A space for EWRs to share women’s issues which are common across party and other lines;
• A platform for local women politicians to make their collective voice heard right up to the state and
national levels; and
• A medium for associations of EWRs to eventually become a part of the larger women’s movement and get
linked to other coalitions such as the National Alliance for People’s Movements.

and providing reservation in recruitment for
government jobs.
While there has been some improvement
in girls’ access to education, progress is still
slow and large differentials remain.
The economic position of women in terms
of work participation, the proportion of
marginal workers, the dependence on
agricultural work, the share of agricultural
wage labour, and the differential in
agricultural wages, all point to a significant
worsening in women’s position in the
Hyderabad Karnataka region and to a
somewhat lesser extent in the Bombay
Karnataka region. The fruits of Karnataka’s
economic IT-led boom have definitely not
reached women in these regions and their
positions are worse than before.
Health indicators point to some improvements
but there is a serious situation developing
with respect to HIV incidence among women
in poor, rural areas where the public health
system is already weak.
The child sex ratio has worsened especially
in the better-off districts, pointing to the
dissonance between overall economic
improvement and human development
and lack of reduction in the aversion to
daughters.
Violence against women due to the spread
and intensity of dowry demands among
other reasons threatens the lives of women
in all socio-economic groups and regions.
Elected women’s representatives oriented
to the women’s constituency could lead to
real political empowerment of women in
rural Karnataka. Active EWRs have also been
setting up women’s sanghas in their villages,
taking further the process of social, economic
and political empowerment of women.

The assessment also points to some gaps and
limitations. The analytical framework identified
four sets of actions that the government must
undertake in order to protect girls and women
from harm, and promote gender equality as a core
element of human development. The government
should support changes in social norms and
practices; promote key legal/political changes;

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

create strong institutions at multiple levels from
the village to the highest levels; and provide
resources and make investments.

BOX 8.4

Some recommendations of the Karnataka Task Force on Women’s
Empowerment

The conclusions are that significant changes have
happened in the political sphere, largely due to
the growing involvement of women as EWRs.
Here, Karnataka is a pioneer in devolving powers
to PRIs and introducing reservation for women.
Another major area in which change appears
to have occurred is in the proliferation of selfhelp groups as the prime vehicle for women’s
economic empowerment.The picture here is more
mixed as many groups exist only on paper, and
others are weak in terms of resources, capacity
building, or other support. The conclusion here is
that the potential certainly exists and there are
surprisingly good outcomes, as the survey shows.
This has to be set-off against the results of the
analysis of the trends in the area of work and
wages that point to growing impoverishment of
women and inequality between the regions, and
therefore, greater economic need.
The score card on most other areas of potential
government action shows the need for
improvement. Much more needs to be done to
change social norms and values, or strengthen
the gender sensitivity of the criminal justice
system. Where institutions are concerned, the
key department for the development of women,
children and the disabled is poorly funded, and
weak in terms of staffing and capacity. It also
tends to be viewed as marginal and reflects the
overall perspective of the government, which is
still ‘welfarist’ in its view of women. There is need
for a strategic vision towards gender equality in
which different elements of governmental action
can fit.
When introduced, the Karnataka Mahila
Abhivrudhi Yojane or KMAY (for an analysis,
see chapter 3 Part III) held out the potential
for a truly pioneering effort. But its effects
have been reduced, over time, to a mechanical
counting exercise rather than any real attempt
to mainstream gender into the functioning of
key departments. Perhaps most significant of all
for the theme of this report, the gender audit of

In March 2000, on International Women’s Day, a task force was established to study programmes
and policies for the overall development of women in Karnataka. The Task Force on Women
Empowerment submitted its report in September 2002. Some of the important recommendations
made by this task force are:
• A centre for women’s empowerment, which will evaluate the impact of policy and programme
interventions to be established;
• An appropriate mechanism for tracking expenditure of funds earmarked for women to be
set up;
• Reservation for women in all commissions and boards/councils that the government sets
up;
• 50 per cent reservation for the development of women and girl children in the area
development fund of legislators;
• A Women’s Protection Cell to be set up at every village;
• A women’s university to be established in Karnataka;
• Special centres that provide training for competitive exams for the IAS and KAS need to be
set up for girls;
• The government should sanction additional funds for girls’ education for the next three
years;
• All committees constituted at the local level for development programmes and schemes
must have 50 per cent reservation for women;
• Part-time employment for women should be encouraged through policy intervention,
especially in the private sector;
• The Stree Shakti scheme must be expanded, and Stree Shakti groups need to be linked
with creches, with food preparation for anganwadis, stitching uniforms and bags for school
students, running PDS shops, and with NABARD; and
• Information about laws and legal redressal must be compiled in a comprehensive publication
and made available to all government agencies.

budgets and financing points to insufficiency in
the availability of resources for women.

Recommendations


First, it is critical to ensure there is an effective
and well-resourced lead institution to
spearhead action. Experience the world over
indicates that women’s departments, ministries
and bureaus remain weak, poorly resourced
and marginal in their impact unless they are
effectively placed within the government.
Currently, the triple responsibility of DWCD for
women, children and disabled people means
there is inadequate focus on gender. Women
number almost half of the people of the state
and a separate focus is essential if their current
marginalisation is to change. This department

needs to be adequately resourced, which is
very far from being the case at present.
Second, the department should be renamed
the department for Women’s Empowerment
and Gender Equality. Karnataka would be
the first to do this.
The department must develop a strategic
plan with clear timelines, achievable short
and long-term goals, and clear actions
to meet those goals. In developing the
strategy (including a vision and mission),
the department should interact closely
with people’s representatives, civil society,
academics and NGOs.
The effort at mainstreaming through KMAY
must be given greater direction and focus so
that the departments involved can have their
capacity for doing work for gender equality
significantly improved.
Top priority should be given to improving
women’s economic situation in the Hyderabad
and Bombay Karnataka regions.
There is urgent need to increase girls’
enrolment in secondary education throughout

the state and especially in the northern
districts.
Improvements in the healthcare system
especially in the Hyderabad Karnataka region,
and with special attention to the feminisation
of HIV/AIDS are of critical importance to
preventing a major health disaster.
The department should develop a major public
education campaign against sex selection,
dowry, and violence against women. This
needs to be coordinated with the police and
legal system where gender sensitisation and
accountability need strengthening.
Improvements are required in the data
and information systems that will allow
the effective monitoring and review of
programmes for gender equality.

These changes can provide the strategic focus and
direction that is missing at present.They constitute
the next step towards fulfilling the promise of full
and equal citizenship that the Constitution of
India makes towards the women of the state and
the country.

Stree Shakti and Swashakti women’s self-help groups: A Survey

Introduction
There are over 1,95,585 self-help groups
(SHGs) in Karnataka under various departmental
programmes, the majority of which are WSHGs or
women’s self-help groups, a strategy which has
emerged world wide as the single most significant
economic development programme for women.
An SHG is a small (12-20) group of poor people
who voluntarily come together to address their
poverty and other social issues.The core activity is
mobilisation of small savings from group members
and group lending from accumulated savings
as well as bank loans. It is for this reason that
SHGs are also known as microfinance or microcredit institutions. Poor people who are viewed
as security risks by the formal banking system
are, thus, enabled to access small loans for both
income generation and consumption purposes.
The SHG also offers its members a much-needed
space for dealing with economic, social and family
problems in a group environment. This process,
can contribute considerably to the ‘empowerment’
of SHG members though the actual effects of
such empowerment may often be transitory or
insubstantial if the programme design fails to
support empowerment enhancing in a concrete
manner.
As some writers2 have observed, both
governments and donor agencies are promoting
microfinance programmes as a blueprint for
simultaneously dealing with both poverty
alleviation and women’s empowerment.
Identified improvements include not merely
an increase in women’s income levels but also
control over their income; greater appreciation
of women’s contribution to the family income
leading to a perceptibly stronger role in
household decision-making about expenditure,
children’s education, marriage of daughters and
overall family welfare, and an enhancement

of women’s participation in community
decision-making resulting in more political space
for women.
In Karnataka, conveying services to poor
women through self-help groups has emerged
as the dominant strategy for combating female
poverty. The state has several programmes
running SHGs and two of the most significant
schemes in terms of funding and outreach are
Stree Shakti and Swashakti, both of which are
implemented by the Department of Women and
Child Development. In terms of magnitude,
Stree Shakti is amazing: on July 1, 2005, the
programme had 1,00,000 groups with an
accumulated savings of Rs.2,88,55,99,002;
62,281 groups have taken loans of
Rs.2,69,30,68,612 from lending institutions
and disbursed loans of Rs.7,30,40,29,967;
Rs.5,11,30,55,592 has been repaid to SHGs and
a sum of Rs.1,94,81,32,653 has been repaid to
banks. Swashakti was a smaller programme, cofinanced by IFAD-IDA and it closed in June 2005.
The Karnataka State Women’s Development
Corporation (KSWDC) managed the Swashakti
scheme to form SHGs through NGOs in 7
districts – Kolar, Tumkur, Chitradurga, Bellary,
Koppal, Raichur and Gulbarga. Thirty-six NGOs
had been contracted to work in 979 project
villages, and they formed 2,100 SHGs with
38,508 members.

In Karnataka, conveying

Objectives of the study
The single largest government sponsored
economic development programme for women
employs the SHG strategy but, with self-help
groups having their origins in NGO-driven projects,
there is some scepticism about the government’s
capacity to manage such programmes, more
specifically when they have been upscaled very
rapidly as with Stree Shakti. The objectives
of the study were to assess the performance
and measure the impact of the SHGs formed
under two government sponsored programmes,

197

Gender and Human Development

Scheduled Caste women
form more than half of the
membership of the
SHGs surveyed, with
Scheduled Tribes,
minorities and backward
classes constituting
another sizable
26 per cent of
the members. The
composition of the groups
therefore is well weighted
in favour of the more
vulnerable socio-economic
sub-groups.

Stree Shakti and Swashakti, with reference to:
• The functioning of SHGs as micro-credit
institutions;
• Their effectiveness in reducing poverty;
• Their effectiveness as gender empowerment
catalysts;
• Their role in effecting changes, if any,
in women’s status in the family and the
community;
• Their effectiveness as agents of socioeconomic change; and
• The adequacy of inputs provided to SHGs by
government.

Methodology
The survey was conducted along with a sample
survey of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SCs
and STs) by the Department of Economics and
Statistics (DES 2004B) although the two studies
are separate and distinct. However, SHGs formed
from 2000-01 onwards, under Stree Shakti and
Swashakti, have been selected primarily from
the very same villages sampled for the SC/ST
survey. One distinct advantage of conducting
this study along with the study on SCs and STs
is that the sample gives fair representation to SC
and ST women who are among the most socioeconomically underprivileged people in their
villages. Out of the 411 selected SHGs, 373 are
Stree Shakti SHGs and 38 are Swashakti groups.

After the selection of an SHG, a maximum number
of 10 group members was selected randomly and
schedules canvassed.

Profile of SHGs
Of the 2,753 self-help groups in the selected (for
the Sample Survey) villages and SC/ST habitations
with a gross membership of 38,330, a high 91
per cent (2,513) were functional on the date of
survey (November 2004). The non-functioning of
some groups was attributed to great poverty (87
per cent of the membership was below the poverty
line) and low literacy levels of the members (37
per cent) as well as lack of motivation and capacity.
The average membership per SHG was about 14.
The formation of 77 per cent (315) of the surveyed
groups (411) was facilitated by anganwadi workers
(AWs), 8 per cent (32) by NGOs, 7 per cent (31)
by government agencies/officials, 2 per cent (8) by
banks, 3 per cent (12) by gram panchayats and 3
per cent (13) by others.
As Table 8.5.1 reveals, Scheduled Caste women
form more than half of the membership of the
SHGs surveyed, with Scheduled Tribes, minorities
and backward classes constituting another sizable
26 per cent of the members. The composition of
the groups therefore is well weighted in favour of
the more vulnerable socio-economic sub-groups.
There is also homogeneity among members in

terms of geographic location (88 per cent) and a
shared socio-economic background (75 per cent).
This is a critical element in facilitating harmonious
and cooperative group dynamics since disparities
of caste, class or even location can be formidable
barriers to ensuring the formation of a cohesive
WSHG.

Chairpersons
The literacy rate among the chairpersons
(60 per cent) of the groups is higher than the state
female literacy rate (57 per cent). Of the literate
women, 25 per cent had studied up to class VII
16 per cent had studied from classes VIII to X
(but failed the SSLC), 14 per cent (59) had passed
the SSLC, and 6 per cent (23) had studied up
to PUC (class XII). The majority of chairpersons
(46 per cent) are between 21 and 34 years
of age, and 37 per cent are in the age group
35–54 years and a sizable number, 14 per cent are
very young women, below 21 years. The relative
youthfulness of the chairpersons is an interesting
trend. The economic profile of the chairpersons
shows that 87 per cent are below the poverty
line (BPL). Half of them are either casual workers
or daily wage earners, 15 per cent are from the
farming community, 16 per cent work at home,
9 per cent are from the salaried class, and 4 per
cent operate micro businesses. Nearly two-third of
the chairpersons are SCs, 14 per cent are STs, 5
per cent are from the minorities, 7 per cent from
the backward classes and 13 per cent are from
other communities.

Office bearers
The educational qualifications of the office bearers
of the SHGs also indicate a relatively high level of
literacy (54 per cent). Overall, chairpersons have
better educational attainments than office bearers.
Close to one-third had studied up to class VII,
12 per cent between class VIII and X, 7 per cent
had passed the SSLC, and 2 per cent had passed
PUC and 1 per cent were graduates. Age-wise,
office bearers are a youthful lot, with over half in
the age group 21-34 years, 32 per cent in the age
group 35-54 years, and 12 per cent of the office
bearers were very young, less than 21 years.
A high 88 per cent of the office bearers are BPL.
Nearly two out of three of the office bearers are
either daily wage or casual workers, 8 per cent are
from the salaried class and a mere 2 per cent are
from petty/small trade, 10 per cent work at home
performing house work.
The data clearly indicates that (i) there is
homogeneity in the composition of the SHG in
terms of age and socio-economic characteristics
while educational attainments show considerable
variation and (ii) the chairpersons and office
bearers share the main characteristics of group
members and, in that sense, are eminently
suitable representatives. Neighbourhood based
groups with a homogeneity of interests and a
decentralised style of functioning ideally perform
better as platforms for women’s participation than
heterogeneous groups with disparities between
members.

In 361 SHGs or 87 per cent, every member had
opened a savings account in a bank.

Linkages with lending institutions
SHGs have several sources of working capital,
i.e. members’ savings, revolving funds from

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

the government and credit from financial
institutions that lend to SHGs in the ratio of 1:10.
Grameen banks contributed a third of the credit
leveraged by groups from financial institutions
with Scheduled banks coming second with
26.8 per cent, cooperative banks contributed
17.3 per cent and 5.4 per cent came from NABARD.
Seventy three per cent of the SHGs repaid loan
instalments regularly. In the remaining cases,
a high 66 per cent said that they had defaulted
on repayments because their members were not
repaying loans in time and 21 per cent admitted
to not having control over their members so they
could not enforce repayment.
SHGs received loans at fairly stiff rates of interest: in
47.2 per cent of SHGs, the interest was 10 per cent,
in 28 per cent of the SHGs, the interest charged
was over 15 per cent and in 10 per cent of the
cases, interest ranged between 10 and 12 per cent.
This in turn, led to SHGs charging their members
a fairly high rate of interest: 54.7 per cent of the
groups charged 15 per cent on loans to members
and 42.1 per cent charged less than 10 per cent.
Micro-credit does not come cheaply.

Lending profile
A sum of Rs. 114.25 lakh has been disbursed
as loans to 63 per cent of SHG members. Of the
members who received credit, about 47 per cent
are BPL. About 5 per cent found it difficult to
get loans for various reasons such as not having
repaid an earlier loan and because they sought
frequent loans. A very high 73.4 per cent had
taken one loan, 21.2 per cent had taken two loans,
3.7 per cent had taken three loans and 1.8
per cent had taken four loans. Loan amounts were
for small sums, ranging from less than Rs.1,000 to
over Rs.10,000. The largest number of loans was
for amounts in the range of Rs.1,000-2,500 (44.4
per cent) and Rs.2,500-5,000 (18.5 per cent).
The region-wise break up of BPL members who
accessed credit is as follows: Bombay Karnataka:
65 per cent, Hyderabad Karnataka: 30.8 per cent
and south Karnataka: 53.19 per cent.
This raises a very crucial issue from the perspective
of the effectiveness of these programmes as a

poverty reduction strategy. These SHGs have a BPL
membership of 87 per cent, yet only 47 per cent of
the loans were disbursed to BPL women, indicating
that the most economically vulnerable women are
not accessing credit. Since loans are given based
on individual member’s savings, it would seem BPL
members could not leverage loans because they did
not save enough. The absorption with repayment
also means that SHGs may exclude those likely to
have difficulties in repaying loans, i.e. the poorest.

Purpose for which loans were taken

Grameen banks
contributed a third of the
credit leveraged by groups
from financial institutions.

About 45 per cent of the loans were taken for
economic activities: income generation activities
(24.70), on-farm activities (13.3), and business
(7.2). The remaining could be classified as
consumption loans: house construction (11.1 per
cent), festivals/functions (10.7), healthcare (9.2)
and children’s education (8).

Loan repayment by members
Repayment of loans shows 86.6 per cent
compliance. Apparently, in countries as diverse as
Bangladesh, Benin, the Philippines and Dominica,
IFAD reports that repayment is as high as
96-97 per cent. The main reasons members
cited for non-payment of loan instalments were
financial constraints and pressure from the spouse
or the family to defer repayment.
How important is the micro-credit function of the
SHG to its members? Very important, since other
sources of credit were insignificant: friends and
relatives helped 12.2 per cent of the members
while another six per cent turned to moneylenders.
Sixteen per cent of the members still owed
money on loans ranging from less than Rs.1,000
(19 per cent) and over Rs.10,000 (17 per cent).

Impact

SHGs have a BPL
membership of
87 per cent, yet only
47 per cent of the loans
were disbursed to BPL
women, indicating that
the most economically
vulnerable women are not
accessing credit. Since
loans are given based
on individual member’s
savings, it would seem
BPL members could not
leverage loans because
they did not save enough.

The impact of microfinance goes beyond income
generation, as discussed earlier. The impact on
women’s social, community and gender roles has
also been studied in the survey. Impacts can vary
within schemes and between women. There are
differences between women engaged in different
productive activities. Sometimes those who are
better-off are able to access credit to the detriment
of the poorer members. Then there are individual
201

Gender and Human Development

differences between women engaged in similar
activities. One may be a good entrepreneur and
another may lack initiative (Mayoux, 1997).4
Hence, it is difficult to expect identical outcomes
from all microfinancing SHGs.

Economic benefits
Often, a microfinance scheme is judged purely
in terms of mobilisation of savings, lending and
repayment. The larger issue of reducing women’s
economic exploitation by either the market or her
family is not factored when preparing report cards
even while organisers loudly proclaim the scheme
is emancipating. Emancipation, however, does not
just happen as a by-product of microfinance.

assumption being that they are now more
articulate and aware of what they can access
under government schemes and have the ability
to get resources from departments. This is not
always the case. Only a quarter had participated
in mass literacy campaigns, health campaigns,
and the midday meal scheme (Akshara Dasoha)
respectively, 15 per cent were involved with
the public distribution system (PDS), and less
than 10 per cent in watershed development,
desilting tanks, SGSY and other employmentgeneration activities. Overall, the level of
linkages and interface with existing programmes
is low.

Control over money
Members reported an improvement in incomes
and the percentage of BPL members went
down from 87 per cent to 77.2 per cent while
the percentage of members above the poverty
line (APL) increased from 13 per cent to 22.8
per cent. As Table 8.22 reveals, the number of
women with a monthly income below Rs.1,000
declined by 18 per cent while the numbers in
all other income categories increased, i.e. by
12 per cent in categories two and three, and by as
much as 26 per cent in category four.
After such improvements, husbands’ contributions
to family income have sometimes come down but
here an overwhelming 90 per cent said it did not
happen.

Linkages with other government
programmes
SHGs are encouraged to avail of benefits
under various government programmes, the

For concrete economic empowerment to take
place, women should ideally have autonomy over
their own incomes.The survey looked at economic
autonomy from two perspectives: freedom to
spend and control over savings. In each category,
the number of women reporting full autonomy
went up considerably (Table 8.5.3).
Members’ autonomy in family decision-making
increased most remarkably with reference to
construction/repair of their houses where the
percentage of members making the decision
on their own shot up from 3.3 to 80.2 per
cent. Consultation with family before buying
household articles decreased only marginally from
71.3 to 68.2 per cent and actually increased,
from 72.5 to 83.7 per cent when buying durable
goods. Overall, members’ dependence on ‘others’
came down thereby pushing up the percentage of
members who made decisions on their own from
14.5 to 25.7 per cent regarding buying household

A high percentage (65.9) joined SHGs because
they encouraged savings, 17.3 per cent saw it as
a way of enhancing their social status and only
14.9 per cent had wanted to avail of credit.

What did they gain?

goods and buying durable goods (from 10.8 to
14.3 per cent). Disappointingly, the spillover into
other critical areas such as sending children to
school and medical expenditure was minimal.
There has been little significant improvement in
women’s autonomy here.

Clearly, members perceive that belonging to a
sangha enhances their social status and leads
to a sense of self-worth. An impressive 79.3
per cent saw their status in the family improving
significantly and 71.2 per cent saw this
translating into an improvement in their status
in the community.There was an increase in social
networking (66.3) and greater participation in
social, cultural and political activities.

Decision to take loans

Changes in family relations

Before joining the SHG, 66.8 per cent of the
women reported consulting the family before
taking a loan and 19.4 per cent decided on their
own. After joining the SHG, dependence on the
family declined to about 61 per cent while the
percentage of members making decisions on
their own increased to 33.5 per cent.

A third of the women noted that their spouses
and/or other family members had altered habits
such as smoking, drinking and using tobacco/pan
masala but another third had seen no changes.
Did women see any changes in their lives in the
context of violence meted out to them by spouses
and other family members? Of the 4,084 women
canvassed only a quarter chose to respond. This,
itself is significant since domestic violence is not a
subject many women like to acknowledge. Those
who responded saw a more than 50 per cent
reduction in physical violence arising out of issues
such as dowry, childlessness, no son, quarrels over
property with the spouse and in-laws.

Problems encountered
A significant majority did not encounter resistance
from spouses or older family members while they
dealt with the process of group membership. The
majority faced no objections regarding the training
programme (89 per cent), dealing with banks and
offices (62.2), and spending time on committee
work (56.6) and dealing with other members’
family problems (53.0).

Women’s definition of programme
objectives
Over 96 per cent agreed that encouraging
savings was the principal objective, followed by
improving access to credit (86.6), and income
generation (86.1). Improving women’s status in
the family (82.0) and in the community (75.4)
was also perceived as an important objective of
the programme. Developing group action (74.4),
improving vocational skills (71.4) and enabling
access to markets (63.4) which are the core
objectives of SHGs, have obviously not made a
strong impact on women’s consciousness.

Improvement in knowledge/skills/
awareness

Programme goals in
both Stree Shakti and
Swashakti include
increasing women’s
knowledge and
awareness on a number
of levels ranging from
managing an SHG, soft
skills such as leadership
and communication
skills, to sensitisation
about gender, health and
education.

and Swashakti include increasing women’s

such as leadership and communication skills, to
sensitisation about gender, health, education
etc. Ideally, participation in SHGs, by providing
women with access to markets and enabling an
interface with institutions such as banks and
government agencies, promotes the accumulation
of skills and knowledge in participants. More than
half the women surveyed said they were aware
of issues relating to children’s education, health
and sanitation and family planning. The role of

About 30 per cent of the members had dealt

the anganwadi worker in imparting information
about healthcare, nutrition and pre-school
education is an important aspect of the ICDS or
Integrated Child Development Scheme. Since the
anganwadi worker is also the facilitator for the
Stree Shakti groups, it is clear that she uses the
group as a forum for imparting information about
health and education quite successfully. Over 40
per cent claim to have derived improved levels of
knowledge, skills and awareness in many other
areas including gender equality (Table 8.5.4).

Community participation
Participation in gram sabhas or village assemblies,
which are statutory bodies constituted under
the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act 1993 where
many decisions are made regarding selection of
works or beneficiaries under various schemes,
is a crucial first step into both community and
political space for women and other marginal
sub-populations. As many as 83 per cent had
attended gram sabhas, with 38.4 per cent attending
6–10 gram sabhas and 24.8 per cent attending
two to five meetings. This level of participation in a
scenario where many villagers do not attend gram
sabhas regularly is very good. A small number
(11.4 per cent) had been elected to local bodies and
18.0 per cent were members of political parties.

Community and social activism
The performance of SHGs in dealing with
community and social issues is disappointing.
204

SHGs did better when it came to helping
members sort out personal problems. SHGs
had satisfactorily mediated property issues (78
per cent), ill treatment by spouses (76), family
quarrels about money (53), marital problems
(33) and advising members about addictive
habits like smoking, using pan and tobacco (21).
This indicates that women’s collectivism can and
does provide counselling services followed by
interventions where necessary.

How can the programme improve?
Women responded that must-haves are capacity
building in gender issues (62 per cent), legal
literacy classes (62.2 per cent) and training in
health issues (54.6 per cent). Some of the core
inputs were found wanting either because they
were insubstantial or because they were not
provided in time or both. Over 54 per cent found
the government subsidy inadequate and 27 per
cent said they did not get it in time. Over 51 per
cent were not satisfied with the training in book
keeping imparted to them and 21.9 per cent
said it was not conducted in a timely manner.
Bank lending was described as inadequate by
50.8 per cent and 23 per cent said it was not
given in time. Training in vocational skills needed
improvements according to 41.8 per cent
while 24.3 per cent noted it was not available
at all. Only 9.8 per cent said it was available.
Marketing support was another area which
needed improvement (47.4) and only 9.6 per
cent said it was available. A high 52.6 per cent
wanted improvements in literacy classes and 19
per cent said this facility was not available.
Clearly, SHG members are in a position to identify
areas where programme inputs must improve as
well as the knowledge and/or skills they need
to upscale incomes and enhance their capacity
as gender-class. Moreover, the household and
their status therein are critically important for

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

these women and constitute the first critical step
towards enlarging their choices.

Critical issues
At state level, only 62 per cent of the one lakh
SHGs formed under Stree Shakti have taken
loans from banks. The average saving per group
is Rs.28,856. Repayment to SHGs by members
is about 70 per cent which clearly needs to
improve. The Swashakti model was implemented
in 5 states including Karnataka. A baseline
survey was undertaken at the start of the project
and the World Bank claims that all-India data
indicates: (i) incomes of women increased from
Rs.4,300 to Rs.8,766; (ii) illiteracy among SCs
and STs declined from 74.3 to 30.9 per cent
and 78 to 55.7 per cent respectively; (iii) about
90 per cent of the women claimed access to and
control over their resources and 96 per cent had a
say in sending their daughter to school compared
with 21 per cent at baseline.

The difference between the two projects is that
Stree Shakti, which is bigger and has greater
coverage, has a more limited objective but
attempts to do a great many things on a tight
budget.
The survey points to the risks associated with
rapidly upscaling a project, as has happened
with Stree Shakti, without providing matching
budgetary support for programme inputs such as
training and revolving funds. It is also a matter
of concern that the poorest are unable to get
credit for various reasons. The poorest women are
the constituency the programme is supposed to
address. Since the main objective is to give credit
to the very poor and enhance their incomes, the
programme falls short here and more analysis is
needed so that this shortcoming is redressed.
The groups surveyed comprise primarily SC, ST
and backward class women, 87 per cent of whom
are below the poverty line. While group savings
and lending is small scale, group lending reached
the majority of the members. Repayment is higher
than the state average. Since some members
reported a decline in poverty from 87 to 77.2
per cent, the programme could be said to have

impacted rural poverty in a limited way. While
gender equity and empowerment in a larger
sense were not part of the Stree Shakti game
plan, the results in terms of an improvement in
women’s sense of self and self-worth are evident.
Enhancement of women’s status in the family and
the community was a spin-off that women rated
highly. If the groups have not been successful in
working as gender empowerment catalysts then it
is because the programme does not provide for it
by way of capacity building of either groups or the
facilitators. As agents of socio-economic change,
the groups were able to bring about changes
within families especially with regard to domestic
205

violence, which came down by 50 per cent. At
community and societal levels, the groups were
less visible. Participation in gram sabhas improved
and this is a significant step towards enlarging
women’s community participation.
The majority of the members wanted more
loans, more revolving funds and more capacity
building in book keeping, vocational skills,
marketing, health education and gender issues.
The importance of providing inputs in time was
repeatedly emphasised by groups.The best way of
ensuring that the programme shapes up to their
expectations is to build a strong participatory
element.The department must use these inputs to
improve the programme’s services.

Recommendations
Given the fact that SHGs are the preferred
anti-poverty strategy for women, it can be concluded

206

that the strategy has met with some success since
groups have reduced poverty, reached out to very
poor women and raised their awareness levels
quite significantly. An important caveat is that the
programmes have not reached the poorest women
who are not in a position to save and who are
poor credit risks. What Stree Shakti must now do
is to focus on the poorest women (BPL) who are
not getting credit for various reasons and ensure
their needs are met by linking them with local
rural wage employment programmes to build a
sustainable base for micro-credit. A second set of
actions must focus on strengthening/diversifying
the vocational base and developing marketing
linkages. Ensuring that services are provided in
time and efficiently speaks of the need for better
governance. Gender sensitisation, literacy, health
and nutrition awareness would be the third set of
actions. All actions must be complementary, not
sequential.


Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation

CHAPTER 7

Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation
Introduction
Shelter is a basic need for human existence – for
protection from the elements as well as to raise
families. And, just as provision of shelter facilitates
human existence, access to drinking water,
sanitation and hygiene rank foremost among the
basic services that affect human development.
Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation
impacts not only poverty and health indicators,
but also has critical gender implications in terms
of women’s work and women’s health. This
chapter deals with these three facets of human
development in Karnataka.

I. HOUSING
While all human beings need shelter, for the poor,
even the most basic shelter may be beyond reach
because they do not own land or because the
cost of building materials and construction is too
high. Shelter is a basic human need. The National
Housing and Habitat Policy, 1998 provides the
framework for the implementation of shelter
programmes in the country. The national agenda
on housing envisages the creation of 2 million
houses every year. The Habitat policy and the
national agenda recognise housing activity as an
engine for substantial employment generation in
the country.

The ‘Working Group on Housing’ for the preparation
of the ‘Tenth Plan Approach Paper’ has observed
that 90 per cent of the housing shortage relates
to the poor and that there is need to increase the
supply of affordable housing to low income groups
through a proper process of allocation of land,
extension of funding assistance and provision of
support services. All the issues identified by the
Working Group relate to the sphere of activity
and responsibility of state governments and local
bodies, and therefore, the success of the National
Housing Policy depends largely on the efforts of
state governments.
Providing better living conditions for people is now
a global concern. The Millennium Development
Goals envisage achieving significant improvements
in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers
by the year 2020. In this context, urban planning
and governance structures have to be made more
effective, and incorporate an explicitly pro-poor
focus on land rights and affordable low-cost
housing to meet the burgeoning demand for
shelter in urban areas.

While all human beings
need shelter, for the
poor, even the most basic
shelter may be beyond
reach because they do not
own land or because the
cost of building materials
and construction is too
high.

The housing scenario
In Karnataka, 54.9 per cent of households live in
permanent houses, as compared with Kerala, which

has the highest percentage of households (68.1
per cent) living in permanent houses among the
southern states.This is above the national average
of 51.8 per cent. A high 35.6 per cent of households
in Karnataka have semi-permanent houses, a
high proportion among southern states, and
above the national average of 30 per cent. Urban
households perform better, with 77.9 per cent
households living in permanent houses, as
compared with only 42.6 per cent in rural areas.
The scenario is reversed with regard to temporary
houses. (Table 7.1)
Karnataka (78.5 per cent) stands fourth among
the southern states with regard to the number of
households living in houses that they own. This is
less than the national average of 86.66 per cent.
Karnataka, with 18.7 per cent households living
in rented houses, ranks just after Tamil Nadu (19.9
BOX 7.1

Karnataka’s Habitat Policy
The state’s millennium policy envisages:
1. Construction of 2,00,000 houses each year and 10,00,000 houses during the period
2000-05 through state government sponsored Ashraya and Ambedkar (the latter scheme
is for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) housing programmes as well as Centrally
sponsored housing programmes for the poor;
2. Preparation of a reliable database for implementing housing programmes for the poor in
rural and urban areas;
3. Ownership of the dwelling units shall be in the name of women except in the case of
widowers, ex-servicemen, and the physically disabled;
4. Quotas for the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in allocation - in 2002-03, the quotas
increased to 40 per cent for SCs from 30 per cent and for STs to 10 per cent from three
per cent;
5. Quotas for the physically disabled were enhanced from three per cent to five per cent in
2003 and for senior citizens without any income, it is two per cent;
6. Establishing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Housing Corporation
as the nodal agency to implement the housing programmes;
7. Providing a subsidy at Rs.10,000 per unit to all (poor) beneficiaries and an additional
subsidy of Rs.10,000 for SCs/STs for houses constructed in rural areas;
8. Procuring, preferably by direct purchase from landowners, lands required for housing in
rural and urban areas;
9. Providing house sites free of cost to eligible beneficiaries in both rural and urban areas;
10. Encouraging beneficiary participation in construction;
11. Providing guarantee for funds borrowed from HUDCO and other financial institutions;
12. Facilitating housing for certain socio-economic groups such as beedi workers, porters in
agricultural market yards, weavers, artisans, leather artisans, safai karmacharis, fisher
people; and
13. Beneficiary selection through gram sabhas.

per cent) among the southern states. However, the
proportion of households owning houses in rural
areas is quite high at 91.2 per cent (Table 7.1).
Across districts, only 24 per cent households in
Raichur district live in permanent houses and
44.3 per cent are in semi-permanent houses, as
compared with Bangalore Urban district, where
89.7 per cent households live in permanent
houses. The proportion of temporary houses is the
highest in Koppal district (33.8 per cent) followed
by Raichur (31.7 per cent), Gadag (28.1 per cent)
and Bellary (24.5 per cent), all of which are in
north Karnataka (Appendix Tables: Series 9).
Bangalore Urban district tops the state in respect
of households living in permanent houses in urban
areas (92.1 per cent) while Bidar (a low HDI district)
tops the state in respect rural households living in
permanent houses (74.5 per cent). Raichur has
the lowest percentage of rural households living in
permanent houses (13.7 per cent) and Gadag has
the lowest percentage of urban households (41.3
per cent) living in permanent houses. Data indicates
that Bangalore Urban has the least percentage of
semi-permanent houses (6.4) in respect of urban
areas (Appendix Tables: Series 9).
Data on the tenure of households indicates that
the lowest percentage of families (45.69) that
own houses are to be found in Bangalore Urban,
which is below the state average of 78.46 per cent.
The highest percentage of households in
Bangalore Urban lived in rented houses (50.73).
The highest percentage (90.94) of households
that own houses is in Chamarajnagar (a low HDI
district) followed by Udupi (90.42) and Bidar
(90.19). In Udupi, a high HDI district, we find only
7.37 per cent of households in rented houses. A
low 68.3 per cent of rural households in Kodagu
district own their houses, followed by Bangalore
Urban (69.0 per cent) while 95.7 per cent of rural
households who own houses are situated in a
relatively underdeveloped district like Bidar. The
urban scenario shows that in Bangalore Urban,
only 43 per cent households own houses while 54
per cent live in rented houses (Appendix Tables:
Series 9).

Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation

There appears to be little correlation between the
economic development of a district and house
ownership patterns. House ownership is high in the
predominantly agrarian north Karnataka districts
where land values are less likely to be affected
by speculation consequent on urbanisation as in
Bangalore Urban. Migration to cities is a factor
that pushes up the percentage of persons living
in rented houses.

House ownership is high

Policy interventions
Given the relatively low percentage of house
ownership in the state, Karnataka has long
recognised the significance of housing as an
important component of the Minimum Needs
Programme. Indeed, Karnataka had launched a
state-funded housing programme for the poor
through the Ashraya and Ambedkar housing
programmes in 1993-94, long before the National
Habitat Policy was formulated. The state has one
of the best housing programmes in the country.

Housing schemes
The Ashraya programme provides assistance of
Rs.20,000 of which Rs.10,000 is a subsidy and
the remaining Rs.10,000 is a loan. For SC/ST
beneficiaries in both Ashraya and Ambedkar
programmes, the entire provision of Rs.20,000
is a subsidy. In the urban Ashraya programme,
the assistance is Rs.25,000 with a beneficiary
contribution of at least Rs.5,000.
The state launched the ambitious ‘One Million
Housing Programme’ in October 2000, which
envisaged the construction of one million dwelling
units in rural and urban areas during the period
2000-05, i.e. 2,00,000 houses each year. Rural
housing has been given primacy with an annual
target of about 1,70,000-2,20,000 houses.
The annual target for the urban programme is
30,000. The cost of urban projects is usually very
high.

BOX 7.2

Some innovative strategies
 Beneficiary participation

Local bodies and SPVs have traditionally constructed housing projects with
little input from beneficiaries. Over the last five years, however, beneficiary
construction has become the preferred mode of implementation, particularly
in the districts of south Karnataka. This mode of construction is facilitated
by the presence of reasonably skilled construction labour such as masons
and underemployed farm labour, which doubles as semi-skilled or unskilled
construction labour. At present, about 80 per cent of the construction of
houses for the economically weaker sections (EWS) in rural areas is
constructed by beneficiaries.This has the advantage of ensuring that dwelling
units address the social, cultural and occupational needs of the beneficiaries
far more effectively than agency-constructed core housing could hope to
achieve. Beneficiary participation takes the form of direct participation
in construction, supervision of work, attending to simple, yet significant,
tasks such as curing cement blocks or masonry to provide additional funds
for construction of the dwelling unit. The generation of local employment
and use of locally available building materials is a crucial economic
outcome of this approach. There is better accountability for the funds since
these are made available to the beneficiaries only when they attain the
prescribed benchmarks. ‘Self-help’ housing does not, however, mean that
beneficiaries are deprived of technical inputs. Taluk panchayat engineering
staff, Nirmithi Kendras and the Karnataka Land Army Corporation (KLAC)
provide construction support to beneficiaries who are unable to construct
their own houses. In urban areas, ‘core’ housing is provided by agencies

158

as a matter of policy to prevent speculation in land, since land markets are
poorly organised and there is heavy demand for house sites, even by the
non-poor and there is every likelihood that sites may be sold to speculators,
thus defeating the purpose of the programme.
 Women’s empowerment

The decision of the state to select only women beneficiaries for assistance
under the housing programmes (barring some exceptions) and give hakku
patras (title deeds) for house sites and houses only in the names of the
women of the household, has had a critical impact on ownership patterns in
a society where land, houses and assets traditionally belong to men. It is a
significant step towards promoting gender equity.
 Community participation

The selection of beneficiaries was initially entrusted to the Ashraya
Committee. Now gram panchayats identify and select beneficiaries,
and the very poor will hopefully now be in a position to articulate their
demands.This is a significant step towards governance through community
participation.
 Social equity

There is specific targeting of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe people
through the Ambedkar (100.0 per cent) and Ashraya programmes
(50.0 per cent).

A village-wise demand survey was conducted by
gram panchayats during May-June 2003 and it
has been estimated that there are 12.26 lakh
houseless people and 10.43 lakh people without
house sites who have asked for assistance under
the programme. Since 2001-02, a large number
of new village settlements known as Navagramas
has been created adjoining, and preferably
abutting existing village settlements to decongest
villages. So far 2,399 Navagramas have been
created to provide better amenities.
Table 7.2 gives details of houses constructed
under the state and Central government sponsored
housing programmes during 1999-2004. State
sponsored schemes constitute 80 per cent of the
rural housing programmes and 87.5 per cent of
the urban housing programmes implemented in
Karnataka.The state had invested over Rs.18,912
million till March 2004 to create 8,96,269
dwelling units.

Recommendations


It would be no exaggeration to state that the
poor find it difficult to borrow for housing.



Commercial banks are unwilling to lend to
the poor, and even if they are willing to do
so, lending norms, guidelines and collateral
security requirements mean that the most
needy get excluded. Hence, in Karnataka,
institutional lending is channelled through
the state government.The concerns of banks
can be met by organising an institutional
partnership with local bodies and
microfinance structures that would ensure
loan recoveries cost-effectively and also
facilitate savings for home loans to meet
credibility requirements. There is definitely
a need for banks to have a fresh look at the
lending norms for the poor to enable them
to access funds for housing.
Currently, provision of infrastructure facilities
like water, electricity, sanitation, internal
roads and drains is not being financed under
any housing programme. This has resulted in
poor occupancy and a poor quality of life for
occupants in the settlements. Infrastructure
provision is extremely resource intensive and
should not be left to cash-starved local bodies
to provide; it should be funded by the state

since the ability of the poor to contribute is

In Karnataka the state survey reveals that
14.31 lakh families are houseless and
15.08 lakh families do not own house sites.
The number of houseless families is the
highest in Belgaum (1.07 lakh) followed
by Gulbarga (1.02 lakh), Kolar (0.99 lakh),
Mysore (0.96 lakh) and Tumkur (0.94).1
Public policy must focus on targeting
resources to districts where the problem of
houselessness is most acute.
An evaluation-cum-audit of the gender
sensitive initiative that mandates that house
title deeds shall be in women’s names must
be taken up to assess the impact of this step
in changing gender relations and empowering
women.
The National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM)
is expected to be the major vehicle for urban
renewal in the country, providing substantial
financial assistance for urban infrastructure
and provision of basic services for the urban
poor. Accordingly, the city development
plans and strategies must focus on enabling
the poor to better access civic services.
Those working in the urban informal sector,
especially women, must be included in the
agenda for urban regeneration.

II. DRINKING WATER AND
SANITATION
Among the basic services that affect human
development are access to drinking water (defined
in terms of availability, proximity and quality),
sanitation and hygiene. Access to drinking water
has implications not only for health status and
human development parameters but also for
opportunities depending upon the opportunity cost
of time. This has special implications for women
and children. The responsibility for fetching water,
sometimes over long distances, for household
needs is invariably assigned to women or girls,
who drop out of school to attend to these chores.
Hence, the ready availability of safe drinking water
lays the foundation for improvement in literacy
and health indicators in communities.
According to the 2001 Census estimates, 31.7
per cent of all households in Karnataka had access
to drinking water within their premises, 46.4
per cent outside the premises, and a substantially
lower number (21.8 per cent) had access away
from the premises.2 Disaggregated data shows
that urban Karnataka is doing better in terms of
facilities; in rural Karnataka, only 18.5 per cent of
households had access to drinking water within
the premises compared with a high 56.5 per cent
for urban Karnataka. However, the statistics
are reversed with regard to access to drinking
water outside the premises, with 55.4 per cent
rural households having access to drinking water
outside the premises as against 29.6 per cent for
urban areas. This unequal pattern continues with
reference to the percentage of households with
access to drinking water away from the premises:
it is 26.1 per cent for rural Karnataka and 13.8
per cent for urban Karnataka (Table 7.3).
However, this pattern holds good for other states
as well: countrywide, access to drinking water
is markedly better in urban areas than in rural
areas. The principal sources of drinking water are
taps, hand pumps, tube wells, wells, tanks, ponds,

source that is beyond 500 metres from the dwellings in rural
areas and beyond 100 metres in urban areas.

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

lakes, rivers, canals and springs, etc. Forty-eight
per cent rural households and 78.4 per cent urban
households access their drinking water from
taps. In rural areas, however, 22.9 per cent of
households rely on hand pumps and 15.6 per cent
on wells while in urban areas; taps constitute the
dominant source (Table 7.4).
Some important indicators available for sanitation
relate to access to bathroom and latrine facilities.
Here, too, the rural–urban difference is marked.
While 79.1 per cent urban households had a
bathroom in the premises, the proportion for rural
areas was 48.1 per cent. While a high 82.5 per cent
of rural households had no latrines in the premises,
only 24.7 per cent urban households did not
have latrines. As many as 44.9 per cent urban
households had water closets. Both urban and rural
households were relatively on a par when it came
to drain connectivity for waste water (rural: 31.1
per cent; urban: 39.3 per cent), the real difference
lies in the fact that 64.6 per cent rural households,
by and large, did not have any kind of drainage
connectivity whereas only 19 per cent urban
dwellers lacked this facility (Table 7.5).

Since the beginning of the 1980s, bore-wells
have been the main basis of water supply
schemes in the state.The policy of the government
is to provide bore-wells with hand pumps to
habitations with a population of less than 500,
mini water supply schemes to habitations with a
population between 500 and 1,000, and piped
water supply schemes to habitations with a
population of more than 1,000. In the last few
years, the groundwater level is being depleted
very quickly in most districts, resulting in a large
number of bore-wells drying up. Strategically,
drilling new bore-wells is now seen to be less
efficient than deepening existing bore-wells to
improve water yields. Surface water sources

schemes and 17,170 piped water schemes
(Annual Report 2004-05: Rural Development
and Panchayat Raj Department). Accordingly,
the percentage of households with access to
safe drinking water has increased from 67.3
per cent in 1991 to 96.08 per cent in 2001
and to 99.0 per cent in 2004. The water supply
service level in terms of litres per capita per day
(lpcd) has also improved since 1991. There were
20,398 habitations with 40 lpcd and above
in 1991, 38,701 habitations in 1999 and in
2004 as many as 41,115 habitations had water
availability of 40 lpcd and above.

Access
Accessibility of drinking water improved to over 80
per cent in all districts in 2001. In rural Karnataka,
18.5 per cent households had access to drinking
water within the premises, as compared with 12.0
per cent in Tamil Nadu, 22.7 per cent in Andhra
Pradesh, 38.9 per cent in Maharashtra and 69.1
per cent in Kerala. Except Kerala, most states,
including Karnataka, have been able to provide
drinking water outside the premises (Table 7.6).
However, a high 26.1 per cent of rural households
in the state access drinking water away from their
premises. Karnataka is close to Andhra Pradesh’s
21.9 per cent in this respect. There are still some
habitations where drought conditions lead to
water being transported in tankers or by train.
Continuous drought conditions from 2001-02 to
2003-04 led to water being transported to about
500 villages in the state. Almost 48.5 per cent of
rural households access their drinking water from
taps compared with 60.5 per cent in Tamil Nadu.
Rural areas primarily rely on hand pumps and
wells while taps constitute the dominant source in
urban areas (Table 7.7).
Among districts, Udupi (56.0 per cent), Dakshina
Kannada (54.0 per cent) and Uttara Kannada
(42.0 per cent) have the highest percentage of
rural households with access to drinking water
within the premises. Raichur (9.0 per cent),
Gulbarga and Bijapur (10.0 per cent) all in
north Karnataka have the lowest percentage of
rural households with access to drinking water
within the premises. Districts with the highest
percentage of rural households with access to

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

drinking water away from the premises are
Raichur (43.0), Gulbarga (41.0) and Bijapur
(36.0). Districts with the lowest percentage of
rural households with access to drinking water
away from the premises are Mandya (14.0), and
Dakshina Kannada (15.0).The arid, water-starved
districts of north Karnataka have problems of
access and sustainability while the coastal and
malnad districts perform better in terms of access
(Appendix Tables: Series 9).
The data on the distribution of households by
location of drinking water reveals that some
districts are heavily dependant on wells, viz.
Udupi (80.0), Dakshina Kannada (70.0) and
Uttara Kannada (65.0) while Chamarajnagar
(46.0), Bijapur (42.0), and, to a lesser extent,
Tumkur (36.0) are primarily dependant on hand
pumps. The remaining districts derive drinking
water principally from taps (Appendix Tables:
Series 9).

Quality
There are over 21,008 habitations with major
quality issues: excess fluoride: 5838; brackishness:
4460; nitrate: 4077 and iron: 6633. The water
in these villages is contaminated with fluoride
(>1.5 mg/litre), total dissolved salts (>1500
mg/litre), nitrate (>100 mg/litre) and/or iron
(1mg/litre). Under the Rajiv Gandhi National
Drinking Water Mission, there is a sub-mission to
deal with the problem of contaminated water. So
far 47 projects have been implemented, covering
628 fluoride affected habitations. Defluoridisation
plants have been set up in 200 villages. Individual
household filters are also being supplied at a
subsidised cost in fluoride affected villages.
Ingestion of fluoride contaminated water causes
fluorosis which causes staining and pitting of
the teeth and, in more severe cases, skeletal
abnormalities, leading to physical disability and
weakness, a consequent fall in labour productivity
and a decline in income levels.

Sustainability
The sustainability of water supply schemes is
a major concern of the government. Over 95
per cent of rural water supply schemes depend
on ground water sources. Over-exploitation of

Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation

Over-exploitation of
groundwater for irrigation
has led to a progressive
decline in the water table
and drying up of aquifers.

groundwater for irrigation has led to a progressive
decline in the water table and drying up of
aquifers. This has rendered many water supply
schemes non-functional. While efforts are being
made to rejuvenate these schemes by taking
recourse to deepening and hydro fracturing
bore-wells, a more sustainable strategy is the
recharging of groundwater through watershed
development. This strategy has been adopted in
the implementation of the Drought Prone Area
Development Programme, Desert Development
Programme, Integrated Wasteland Development
Programme, Western Ghat Development
Programme, etc. This has helped to recharge
groundwater in these areas.

Rural sanitation
Compared to the progress in rural water supply
in Karnataka, the progress in rural sanitation has
not been very satisfactory. While there has been a
sustained attempt to improve the provisioning of
safe drinking water since the 1980s, no such parallel
effort or investment was evident in rural sanitation.
It was only in the 1990s that this area became
the focus of policy interventions with the launch
of special schemes to provide toilets and sanitary
facilities in villages, viz. Nirmala Grama and Swasthi
Grama. Another programme, Swachcha Grama,
was launched in 2001 with an integrated focus
aimed at providing five facilities: (i) paving internal
roads and streets in the village; (ii) construction
of efficient sullage and storm water drainage; (iii)
providing community compost yards and removal of
manure pits from the dwelling areas of the village;
(iv) providing smokeless chulahs for all households;
and (v) construction of household, community and
school latrines in all villages. That these schemes
still have to make an impact is clear from the data
from the 2001 Census. A high 82.5 per cent of
rural households had no latrine in the house but
this is more or less on par with other neighbouring
states except Kerala (18.7 per cent only). The
percentage of rural households with bathrooms is
48.1 per cent, which is higher than Maharashtra
(46.1 per cent), Tamil Nadu (21.0 per cent)
and Andhra Pradesh (27.1 per cent) except Kerala
(56.5 per cent). Admittedly, 64.6 per cent of rural
households had no drainage connectivity for the
wastewater outlet, but this was still better than

164

Gujarat (86.3 per cent), Kerala (84.0 per cent)
and Tamil Nadu (72.6 per cent) (Table 7.8). Lack
of drainage facilities and toilets results in a highly
unsanitary environment, which is a precursor to
high morbidity rates.
District-wise data reveals that Udupi has the best
coverage of latrines (49.9 per cent) followed by
Kodagu (48.5 per cent), Dakshina Kannada (47.2
per cent) and Bangalore Urban (41.0 per cent). A
high 96.7 per cent of rural households in Bijapur
do not have latrines, followed by Gulbarga (94.9
per cent) and Bagalkot (94.6 per cent) (Appendix
Tables: Series 9).

Urban water supply and
sanitation
Urbanisation
The urban population in Karnataka has grown
from 16,40,000 in 1901 to 1,79,10,000 in
2001. The proportion of urban population to total
population of Karnataka is 33.98 per cent, higher
than the average for the country, which is 27.78
per cent. The state accounts for 6.28 per cent
of the country’s urban population, lower than
Maharashtra’s 14.37 per cent and Uttar Pradesh’s
12.09 per cent. Among the 27 districts of the
state, Bangalore Urban district has the highest
concentration of urban population, with almost
88.08 per cent of the district population residing
in urban areas. The district accounts for over 32
per cent of the urban population of the state. The
next highest concentration of urban population is
in Dharwad district (4.92 per cent) while Kodagu
district has only 0.42 per cent of urban population,
the lowest among all districts in the state. Haveri
district has seen the highest decadal growth rate
of urban population of 46.69 per cent between
1991 and 2001.
About half of the urban households in Karnataka
have access to drinking water within the
premises, which is below the national average
of 65.4 per cent. A third of households in
Karnataka have access to drinking water outside
the premises which is lower than 41.3 per cent
in Tamil Nadu but higher than Kerala (13.6
per cent), Gujarat (20.0 per cent) and Maharashtra

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

(21.1 per cent). In Karnataka 13.8 per cent of
households have access to drinking water away
from the premises, which is the highest among
the southern states (Table 7.6). The source-wise
data reveals that taps constitute the major source
of drinking water in urban Karnataka (78.4
per cent), which is higher than the national
average of 68.7 per cent. Maharashtra leads
with 89.2 per cent followed by Gujarat (83.0
per cent) (Table 7.7).
Across districts, in Koppal only 27.0 per cent of
households have access to drinking water within
the premises followed by Raichur (33.0 per cent),
Gadag (34.0 per cent), Bagalkot and Bellary
(36.0 per cent). Certain districts such as Mysore
(91.0), Gadag (89.0), Hassan and Bellary (88.0),
Bangalore Urban, Chamarajnagar and Chitradurga
(87.0), Tumkur and Kolar (86.0), perform better
in terms of access to tap water than Bangalore
Rural (80.0). Bidar performs poorly, with only
59.0 per cent except for Udupi, Uttara Kannada
and Dakshina Kannada where well water is the
dominant source of drinking water. In both Bidar
and Dharwad, 4.0 per cent of urban households
depend on other sources like tanks, ponds, lakes,
rivers, canals and springs (Appendix Tables:
Series 9).
Urban local bodies in Karnataka comprise
six municipal corporations, 40 City Municipal
Councils (CMCs), 91 Town Municipal Councils
(TMCs) and 82 Town Panchayats. These bodies
are entrusted with the duty of managing
water supply and sanitation in urban areas. A
persistent charge levelled against urban areas
is that they appropriate the lion’s share of the
state’s resources in water supply and sanitation.
Certainly, urban households across the country,
have better access to drinking water and
sanitation facilities than their rural counterparts
(Tables 7.6, 7.7 and Appendix Tables: Series 9).
However, urban water supply and sanitation
has its own constraints and inequities.

Urban water supply
Water is essential to life and a vital natural
resource in economic activities, but lack of access
to adequate, safe drinking water at an affordable

Urban water supply is
inefficiently managed
with massive investments
being wasted. Most of
water squandering takes
place because of the
under-pricing of water.
In addition, excessive
use of water also causes
severe water pollution,
groundwater depletion
and soil degradation.

price has been a problem for most urban local
bodies (ULBs), especially its poorer residents.
Urban water supply is inefficiently managed
with massive investments being wasted. Most of
water squandering takes place because of the
under-pricing of water. In addition, excessive
use of water also causes severe water pollution,
groundwater depletion and soil degradation.
Moreover, water is distributed very unevenly (with
the southern parts of Karnataka at an advantage
over the relatively drier northern counterparts)3 in
the state and many villages and towns currently
face critical water shortages that undermine
human health and economic development.

from property tax realisations. This amount was
about Rs.1,000 lakh for 2002-03, resulting
in a net operating deficit of Rs.15,000 lakh.
This deficit is met through other revenue
(non-water related) of ULBs like property tax,
SFC devolutions and other grants/loans.

Most ULBs receive water only for a few hours on
alternate days. The reasons include limitations in
source availability, inefficient distribution networks,
erratic power supply and poor management
practices. Losses through retail distribution, illegal
connections and public fountains contribute to
a high level of ‘unaccounted for water’ (UFW).
Though accurate data is not available on UFW, the
estimates vary between 30 and 70 per cent for
most ULBs.

Piped water is also supplied through public
fountains (PFs) for local communities, typically
comprising the urban poor or where individual
household connections cannot be provided,
either for economic reasons or due to physical
constraints. There are an estimated 73,000 public
fountains in Karnataka (excluding Bangalore).
Water supply through public fountains is erratic
and is also contingent on availability of power.
Typically, water is supplied two or three times
a week for only a few hours. Water losses from
PFs are high due to improper water management
practices and faulty (leaking) taps and pipes. PFs
have also become a source for unauthorised access
to water for vendors, who exploit the potential for
commercial gains from sale of such water.

Consumption is not metered, except in Bangalore
Urban district, hence volumetric tariffs are not
levied in the state. Since the rationalisation of
tariffs, most ULBs charge a flat tariff of Rs.45
per household per month. The tariff structure
also prescribes a separate debt-servicing levy,
which is not implemented in practice. Compared
to the O&M expenses of Rs.206 crore incurred
in 2002-03, the revenue realisation from
water tariffs (including connection charges)
was Rs.4,600 lakh (about 22 per cent of O&M
expenses). Additional revenue support is also
available through apportionment of water cess

Compared to 84 per cent of towns in south Karnataka, 92
per cent of towns in north Karnataka suffer from inadequate
water supply (Report of High Power Committee for Redressal
of Regional Imbalances, 2002). The inadequacy of source
of water is also more acute in north Karnataka, given weak
monsoon activity in the region, especially in summer. Places
like Dharwad, Gulbarga, Bidar and Raichur actually are forced
to rely on containerised supply of water from other places to
meet their needs in summer. Coastal Karnataka and the Cauvery
region have adequate sources availability and relatively better
than other parts of the state.

Most ULBs did not/could not supply water in
accordance with design norms as of year-end
2001. Lpcd in individual ULBs vary over a wide
range. Thus, even though the calculated lpcd of
ULBs is high, the actual water availability is low.
Most ULBs have water supply on alternate days
and one or two hours per day.

Urban sanitation
Nearly 80 per cent of urban households in
Karnataka have bathrooms within the premises,
which is above the national average of 70.4
per cent. Over 75 per cent of urban households
have latrines within the premises in Karnataka
compared with 92.1 per cent in Kerala and 78.1
per cent in Andhra Pradesh. In Karnataka overall
drainage connectivity (80.9 per cent) is better than
the national average of 77.9 per cent. A high 91.1
per cent of households in Bangalore Urban district
have latrines while 66.5 per cent of households in
Gadag lack this facility (Appendix Tables: Series 9).
Among the four mahanagara palikas in Karnataka,
Bangalore city has the maximum households with
latrines (91.1 per cent) followed by Mysore with
89.7 per cent and Gulbarga has the least with

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

57.2 per cent. By and large, the towns of north
Karnataka have inadequate latrine facilities.

Distribution of main source of drinking water in urban slums
(Per cent)

Water supply and sanitation in urban
slums
Urban slums have high concentrations of poor
people living in very basic conditions in the middle
of affluence. Table 7.9 gives the distribution of
the main source of drinking water supply in
notified and non-notified slums in Karnataka, in
comparison with the all-India average.
As this table indicates, Karnataka’s performance
is better than the national average in terms of
access to water from a relatively efficient source
namely taps. Further, only 28 per cent slums in
Karnataka are water-logged during monsoon
(in both notified and non-notified slums) as
compared to the national average of 36 per
cent for notified slums and 54 per cent for nonnotified slums. This, again, shows that Karnataka
performs better than the national average in
terms of drainage facilities. However, 66 per cent
of notified slums in Karnataka have no latrines as
against the national average of 17 per cent. The
gap for non-notified slums between Karnataka
and the national average appears to be less with
Karnataka recording 53 per cent against the
Indian average of 51 per cent. Similarly, only
23 per cent of notified slums in Karnataka have
under ground drainage (UGD) facilities as against
the national average of 30 per cent. However, 24
per cent of non-notified slums in Karnataka have
UGD coverage as against the national average of
15 per cent.

funds released by government out of SFC grants.
The low allocation to the urban sector and lack of
timely availability of funds have partly contributed
to the sub-optimal service delivery of water and
sanitation services. The rural sector is slightly better
served in terms of fund flows. The Karnataka Urban
Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB)
estimates that Rs.4,79,699 lakh (approximately
US$ 1 billion) is required to enable ULBs to conform
to minimum design standards. In sum, Karnataka
has done well in the rural sector as far as drinking
water supply is concerned, but there are challenges
in the path to reaching accepted norms across all
districts. The biggest challenges are in the urban
sector, where complex issues of tariffs have to be
faced.

Tariff setting: efficiency in governance
The State Urban Drinking Water and Sanitation
Sector Policy states ‘The longer term objective is to
establish an appropriate cost recovery mechanism
through adequate tariff to ensure that revenues
cover operations and maintenance costs, debt
service plus a reasonable return on capital…
Tariff will be structured in a manner such as to
disincentives excessive consumption and wastage
of water, whilst ensuring at least a minimum “life
line” supply to the poor.’

Subsidies to drinking
water end up favouring
the rich disproportionably,
since they have more
ready access to public
water supplies.

168

There are typically two principal forms of water
subsidisation — grants and low-interest loans
— both found in Karnataka. With the estimated
investments for the sector very likely to grow,
since the unit costs of new water supplies will
double, and in some cases, even triple, compared
with the present systems, even before including
environmental costs, there is an urgent need to
efficiently manage the finances.This is particularly
critical as the real cost of water may soon be out
of reach for the economically weaker sections.
The initiatives in this regard include savings
from regularising illegal connections, savings
from improved efficiencies, contributions from
the users and higher charges, wherever feasible.
Many believe that water subsidies are necessary
for social purposes, in particular to support the
poor. In fact, subsidies to drinking water end up
favouring the rich disproportionably, since they
have more ready access to public water supplies.
The evidence reveals a vicious circle: when
services are heavily subsidised, their quality is
low and service expansion relatively slow because
of lack of resources and their inefficient use. The

consequences are that the rich benefit while the
poor still have relatively high water expenses.
At the same time, the health of the poor suffers
because of inefficient water services. Current
subsidies do not always reach the target groups
and require to be restructured.
It could be inferred that low water prices generally
do not benefit the poor. However, this does not
necessarily imply that water subsidies are bad
and should always be avoided. Instead, they must
target the (financing) needs of the poor more
cost-effectively. Governments may, for instance,
choose to provide subsidies for micro-credit in
order to ensure income access, or issue subsidised
water stamps for the poor or apply ‘life line’
water pricing (a low rate for a basic service level
and an increasing rate above). When carefully
implemented and targeted, such a reform of
water subsidies may very well improve the lot of
the poor.
Proper water policies and action plans are
needed to adequately address current and future
problems of water misuse, increasing scarcity and
pollution. It points to the need for demand-driven
water policies to complement the traditional
supply-oriented approach, to reallocate existing
water supplies, to encourage a more efficient use
and to ensure an equitable access. A key priority
is reallocation between various users. Reforms
of current pricing and incentive measures,
institutional changes, technical improvements
and education and information are all needed
to promote most sustainable forms of water
development and use.

Income, Employment and Poverty
Introduction
Poverty has received special policy focus among
the international development goals accepted by
the UN member countries on the eve of the new
millennium. In fact, it is the first and foremost
goal specified in the Millennium Development
Goals. The goal is to reduce poverty by half
between the base year 1990, and the reference
year, 2015. What is most important here is the
explicit recognition that poverty has multiple
dimensions, with implications for opportunities,
security and empowerment. Any discussion
on poverty during the new millennium must,
therefore, focus on the different dimensions of
deprivation and their policy implications before
attempting to evaluate policy efforts to deal
with them. This chapter will highlight issues
relating to poverty, income and employment in
Karnataka along with policy efforts to deal with
these issues.

Income distribution and
income poverty: Institutional
parameters
Income and consumption distribution, and
the incidence of income poverty depend on
the distribution of assets and employment
opportunities for utilising the only endowment of
the asset-less rural poor, i.e. labour, and its price,
viz. real wage rate. Hence, this section will examine
the situation in rural Karnataka with respect to
these factors that have critical implications for
income distribution and poverty.
The sectoral distribution of state income shows a
decline in the share of the primary sector from
38.10 per cent in 1993-94 to 20.90 per cent
in 2003-04. The secondary sector’s share
has increased marginally, from 24 per cent in
1993-94 to 25.5 per cent in 2003-04. There
is, however, a significant increase in the share of
the tertiary sector, with 37.9 per cent in 1993-94
increasing to nearly 54 per cent in 2003-04,
contributing to more than half of the state’s
income.

The average area of operational holdings1
in Karnataka in 1991-92 was 1.85 hectare
(ha.), which was higher than the all-India
estimate of 1.34 ha. The extent of inequality
in the distribution of operational holdings, as
measured by the Gini ratio, was 0.609 (0.641)
in rural Karnataka (all-India). Available estimates
indicate an increase in the extent of inequality
between three time-points in rural Karnataka
as well as in rural all-India (Table 4.2).
During the same period, the percentage of
marginal holdings increased from 28.76
per cent (45.77 per cent) to 38.40 per cent (56.00
per cent), and finally, to 49.71 per cent (62.79
per cent) in rural Karnataka (rural all-India);
the corresponding estimates of area operated
were 5.10 per cent (9.21 per cent), 5.80
per cent (11.50 per cent) and 9.56 per cent
(15.60 per cent) respectively (NSSO 1997).
The distributional perspective indicates that
the percentage of tenant holdings is low in
Karnataka (8.0 per cent in 1991-92) relative
to the all-India level (11.0 per cent) (NSSO
1997). This is an outcome of the land reforms
implemented in the 1980s. However, from
the perspective of vulnerability (a major focus
of any debate on deprivation), the percentage

1

Poverty is the first and
foremost goal specified
in the Millennium
Development Goals.

The NSS defines an operational holding as a techno-economic
unit used wholly or partly for agricultural production and
operated (directed/managed) by one person alone, or with the
assistance of others, without regard to title, size or location. The
unit may consist of one or more parcels of land and would be
comprehensive with respect to land, agricultural equipments,
machinery and draught animals etc.

agricultural production and productivity, as well
as for poverty and deprivation.

The economic profile of the population by different
occupational categories, their relative importance
and their differential participation in the growth
process provides invaluable inputs for poverty
reduction policies. Such a profile can be explained
with the help of important measures of the quality
of life such as monthly per capita consumer
expenditure (MPCE), incidence of poverty and
relative inequality in levels of living. The relative
importance of each occupational group from
the perspective of equity can be assessed with
reference to its relative size, i.e. its percentage
share in the total population. Estimates of all
the relevant parameters are provided in Table
4.3. Some major features of the profiles by
occupational categories are presented in Box 4.1.

BOX 4.1

Major features of occupational categories
1. Agricultural labour households constitute the largest segment and account for 40 per cent
of the total population in rural Karnataka.The average level of consumption of this segment
is the lowest. The extent of relative inequality in consumption is also low. Accordingly, the
incidence of poverty among agricultural labour households is the highest across different
occupational groups. Variations in real wages and district poverty estimates are closely
interlinked, providing good inputs for strategies for improving the levels of living of the
poor.
2. The self-employed in agriculture constitute the second largest segment (38 per cent). Its
average consumption level being relatively higher, its incidence of poverty is the second
lowest in rural Karnataka. Agricultural labour households, together with the self-employed
in agriculture, constitute the bulk (78 per cent) of the rural population.
3. In urban Karnataka, the regular wage/salary earning class constitutes the largest
occupational group. It is also the richest in terms of measures of average consumption and
deprivation; incidence of poverty in this group is a mere 14.43 per cent. Casual labour
households, though accounting for less than a sixth of total urban population, constitute
the poorest segment. Their average consumption is the lowest and more than half of them
are poor.

76

Rate of growth and regional
disparities
Karnataka’s economy grew at the rate of 4.8
per cent per annum during the decade of the
1980s, i.e. at a rate less than the all-India average
of 5.4 per cent (World Bank, 2002c). However, its
growth rate picked up in the 1990s when it reached
6.9 per cent and exceeded the all-India average
(6.1 per cent).
Between 1993-94 and 2003-04, the state’s
manufacturing and service sectors grew at 7.50
and 10.61 per cent respectively (Table 4.4), while
the primary sector grew at a relatively lower rate
of 0.61 per cent per annum. During this period,
the economy as a whole grew at a rate of 6.84
per cent per annum and the average growth rate
of per capita income has been commendable at
5.30 per cent per annum.
Consequently, Karnataka’s share in the total
GDP of the nation increased from 4.8 per cent
in 1990-91 to 5.22 per cent in 2001-02 (GoK,
Economic Survey 2002-03). In 2002-03, the

per capita State Domestic Product at current
prices (Rs.19,865) was higher than the national
average (Rs.18,912) (GoK, Economic Survey
2004-05).
Karnataka is marked by strong regional disparities.
Bangalore Urban and Dakshina Kannada emerged
as the most developed districts in 1980-81
(Iyengar and Sudarshan, 1983) with Kodagu,
Shimoga, Dharwad and Belgaum following
closely behind. Bellary, Mandya, Chikmaglur,
Mysore, Chitradurga, Uttara Kannada and Kolar
were in the developing category. Hassan, Tumkur
and Bijapur were the backward districts. Three
Hyderabad Karnataka districts, viz. Raichur, Bidar

and Gulbarga, emerged as the most backward
districts of Karnataka. By 2001-02, Bangalore
Urban, Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Bangalore
Rural, Udupi, Mysore and Chikmaglur were
generating a per capita domestic product higher
than the state average (Table 4.5). The city of
Bangalore alone contributed about 22 per cent
of the state income; Bangalore Rural and Urban
districts together generated a quarter of the state
income.These two districts share nearly 16 per cent
of the state’s population in 2001. Bijapur, along
with the Hyderabad Karnataka triumvirate of
Bidar, Gulbarga and Raichur continued to be
in the poorest quartile in terms of per capita
domestic product. The pattern of growth over two

decades indicates a stratification of districts based
on geographic location, with the northern districts
consistently performing poorly. This has serious
implications for the distribution of poverty across
districts.

Labour productivity: Regional
dimensions

An encouraging trend is
the fact that out of the
seven districts which have
experienced growth rates
higher than the state
average, Koppal, Gadag,
Haveri and Bagalkot are
in north Karnataka.

Estimates of the level of labour productivity and
its growth are important indicators of poverty
and human development. They measure the
potential for improvement in the quality of life
of the people. Estimates of labour productivity
for all the 27 districts for the year 2000-01
(Table 4.6) reveal that labour productivity was
highest in Bangalore Urban district, followed by
Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts in 1991,
and these districts retained their ranking in 2001
as well (except Kodagu). It may be noted that all
districts (except Dharwad) in north Karnataka
had labour productivity below the state average
in 1991 and 2001. While Haveri district had the

lowest labour productivity in 1991, followed by
Tumkur and Koppal districts, in 2001 Raichur
had the lowest labour productivity, followed by
Tumkur and Haveri districts. The relative ranking
of Raichur district has come down from 17 in
1991 to 27 in 2001. The annual compound
growth of labour productivity was the highest in
Bangalore Rural, followed by Bangalore Urban
between 1991 and 2001. Other districts which
have growth rates higher than the state average
(5.30) are Koppal, Mysore, Gadag, Haveri and
Bagalkot. An encouraging trend is the fact that
out of the seven districts which have experienced
growth rates higher than the state average,
Koppal, Gadag, Haveri and Bagalkot are in north
Karnataka.

Migration
According to the NSS data on migration for
the year 1999-2000, about 27 per cent of the
state’s population is migrant. The proportion of
migration in urban Karnataka is 33 per cent as

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

compared to 26 per cent migrant population in
rural areas. Among the total migrants, female
migrants (77 per cent) outnumber male migrants
(23 per cent) significantly. However, the proportion
of females who migrate for reasons of employment
is significantly lower than males. A high percentage
of migrants, 57.3 per cent of urban and 34.2
per cent of rural migrants, are males who migrated
in search of employment contrasted with only
3.9 per cent urban females and 1.8 per cent
rural females.

Trends in wages and prices
Agricultural labourers constitute the bulk of the
rural poor in Karnataka. Their endowment of
assets is virtually nil; hence, their level of living
depends upon their income earning potential,
as reflected in the available employment
opportunities and real wages for unskilled labour.
Available estimates indicate that average real
wages (i.e. nominal wages adjusted for increase
in cost-of-living reported by the Consumer
Price Index for Agricultural Labourers) in rural
Karnataka in December 2004 exceeded the level
in the agricultural year (AY) 1993-94 by about
47 per cent for men and 35.4 per cent for women
respectively (Table 4.7). When compared with the
base period of 1993-94, real wages for women
are lower by 12 percentage points as compared
to men.
There are wide variations across districts in the
changes in real wages in comparison with the
base period, 1993-94. Dharwad has registered
the highest increase in real wages for men
between 1993-94 and 2003-04 (161 per cent)
followed by Haveri (156 per cent). Kodagu has
experienced negative changes in real wages for
men, while Kolar and Mandya have experienced
no change in real wages for men. Changes in
real wages for women during this period are the
highest in Haveri district (203 per cent), followed
by 100.56 per cent in Dharwad, while Mandya has
experienced negative changes. The above analysis
shows that real wages for men have increased
substantially more than the wages for women
during the period from 1993-94 to December
2004. This trend is discussed in greater detail in
the chapter on gender.

Income deprivation
A crucial aspect of material deprivation is income
deprivation, which is examined in terms of
estimates of poverty based on the National Sample
Survey on household consumer expenditure
distribution, which is generally used as a proxy for
income distribution.

Estimates reveal a reduction in the number
of the poor from 156.45 lakh in 1993-94 to
104.40 lakh in 1999-2000 in Karnataka, i.e. by
about 33 per cent (Table 4.8). This performance
is much better than the all-India reduction by
18.8 per cent (from 3,203.68 lakh to 2,602.50
lakh) during the same period. As a proportion
80

of the population, poverty in Karnataka declined
from 33.16 to 20.04 per cent (reduction of about
13 percentage points) as against the all-India
decline from 35.97 to 26.10 per cent (reduction
of 10 percentage points) during the same period.
As a result of economic growth and the poverty
reduction strategies of the government, the state
is moving towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. The government must,
however, ensure that the process of growth and
poverty alleviation policies continues and the
disparities of caste, gender and region addressed
at the grassroots level.
Table 4.9 shows that in 1993-94, Kodagu, with
its per capita domestic product of Rs.13,718
was first among all the districts, while in 19992000 Bangalore Urban is first with Rs.25,740.
Bidar continues as the poorest performer in the
list of 20 districts, though its per capita domestic
product increased by 46 per cent during this
period. Head count ratio indicates that in 1993-94,
Bidar had the highest percentage of poor people
(56.1 per cent). Bangalore Rural has seen a
tremendous decline in its head count ratio from
38.2 per cent in 1993-94 to 5.2 per cent in 19992000. One interesting point to note is that in
Raichur, the head count ratio has, indeed, increased
subsequently.This is an important area where state
policy will have to take remedial steps.

Poverty and levels of living by social
groups
This section provides a profile across different
social groups (Table 4.10). The Scheduled Caste
(SC) households account for about 20 per cent
of the rural population. Together with Scheduled
Tribe (ST) households, they form nearly 28 per cent
of the rural population. These two social categories
have the lowest levels of average consumption
and the highest incidence of poverty. About 25
per cent of their respective populations is poor. In
urban Karnataka, the combined population share
of the SCs and STs is about 15 per cent. Nearly
half of these two social categories are poor, whereas
this proportion comes to only a sixth for other
households.Thus, there exists a sharp gap between
these social groups and the rest of the population in
terms of improvements in levels of living.

In Karnataka, about
23 per cent
of the rural child
population lives in poor
households while the
incidence of urban child
poverty is one and a half
times that of the rural
areas.

the ground reality as well as potential for human
development of both, the individual and society.
Children from poor households perform poorly
relative to those from non-poor households with
respect to food security, health and education.
Therefore, estimates of the incidence of child
poverty are useful in that they indicate the
percentage of children living in misery with
a bleak future. Hence, this parameter has
policy implications in terms of policy design,
regional targeting and budgetary support. Some
estimates of the magnitude of child poverty
in rural and urban Karnataka are presented in
Table 4.11.
Poverty is defined and estimated with reference to
consumption which is measured at the household
level. In other words, child poverty could be
defined as the proportion of children living in
consumption-poor households. Estimates for
the year 1999-2000 show that the incidence of
child poverty is about the same in both rural and
urban sectors, across India as a whole. However,
the incidence of child poverty in urban areas is
twice that of the rural levels in Andhra Pradesh
and Kerala. In Karnataka, about 23 per cent
of the rural child population lives in poor
households while the incidence of urban child
poverty is one and a half times that of the rural
areas (Table 4.11).

Child labour
Among the remaining social groups, ‘Other
Backward Communities’ (OBCs) constitute
39 per cent of the rural population, of whom
16 per cent are below the poverty line, which
is significantly lower than the proportion of poor
among the SCs and STs. In urban Karnataka
OBCs constitute about 31 per cent of the urban
population and nearly 30 per cent of them are
poor – a proportion almost double that of their
rural counterparts.

Child poverty
A subset of the poor that calls for policy attention
with regard to all the multiple parameters of
deprivation is that of ‘children under 15’. Child
poverty will have a lasting adverse impact on

Child labour is a manifestation of household
poverty, which is exploited by employers who
do not wish to pay adult wages. Child labour
is a violation of child as well as human rights.
It stunts the development of the child during
his/her crucial learning years and leads to
irreparable physical and psychological damage,
impairing for life, his/her opportunities for
social mobility. Child labour also creates a
vicious cycle of illiteracy and low income, while
simultaneously depriving adults of employment
and higher wages. The prevalence of child labour
also deprives the nation of an educated, skilled
and productive workforce which could form the
basis of rapid economic growth. Thus, employing
children robs them of their childhood and stunts
the growth of the nation.

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

The absolute number of child labour in India
was estimated to be about 12.59 million,2 with
a labour force participation rate of more than 5
per cent according to the 2001 census, with
Karnataka contributing 8.23 lakh as compared to
9.76 lakh child labour in 1991. However, when
compared to the neighbouring states of Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, it is evident that
Karnataka has the second highest child work
participation rate of 13.9 per cent, next only to
Andhra Pradesh, which has 17.8 per cent.
If enrolment and dropout data for the past seven
years, based on the Education Department’s
statistics are considered (1996-97 to 2003-04), a
total of 97.9 lakh children were enrolled in class I
over the last seven years, and 18.39 lakh children
dropped out, which constitutes 18.78 per cent
of the total children enrolled. In addition, 45.54
per cent of children failed to complete eight years
of compulsory schooling. If we go by the definition
that ‘any child out of school is a child labourer’,
then 45 per cent of the children in Karnataka are
child labourers for some period of their childhood
and 18 per cent are child labourers at any given
point of time. Though the percentage of dropouts
may be decreasing, the absolute numbers of
out-of-school children are still large.
According to the National Family Health SurveyIndia (1998-99) for Karnataka, conducted by the
International Institute for Population Sciences,
cultural attitudes, such as lack of interest in
education or child marriage, accounted for the
main reason, for an average of 43.4 per cent of
the responses, for not enrolling children or taking
them out of school. Poverty related reasons, such
as ‘the child is required to work’ or ‘schooling costs
too much’, accounted for 36.18 per cent of the
responses. School-related reasons, such as ‘the
school is too far away’ or ‘school facilities are not
adequate’ were cited by 10.65 per cent of the
respondents.
The distribution pattern of child labour across
different sectors indicates that child work

sectoral distribution pattern of child labour shows
that child workers are employed primarily in
the unorganised farm sector and their collective
share as cultivators and agricultural labourers is
more than three-fourth of the total child labour
population (Table 4.13).
Thus, there is an urgent need for intensive and
concerted efforts to not only target working
children and motivate them to attend school
and complete at least eight years of elementary
education, but also provide institutional
arrangements and support to facilitate this
process.
In the current economy, there are emerging
demands for child labour from new sectors. For
instance, while child labour in the silk-twisting
sector has been decreasing, it has been increasing

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

in the hybrid cotton seed producing sector, as a
result of a shift from subsistence agriculture to
commercial crop production. The service industry
and floriculture are other sectors where child
labour is increasing steadily under the impact of
global markets. Domestic labour is another area
where there is much abuse and exploitation.

State interventions
Despite several interventions, the impact of
government programmes on the prevalence of
child labour has not been satisfactory for various
reasons. The focus, so far, has been on a welfare
approach and on persuasion, exhortation and
incentives, rather than a rights-based approach.
Further, a strategy to address the causes at
source has not received the same attention as
a curative approach. Policies concentrate on
rehabilitation through universal enrolment and
retention. This has made rehabilitation an endless
exercise since the school system has continued to
leak fresh dropouts, even as earlier dropouts are
rehabilitated. Dropouts occur as a result of both
pull-out and push-out factors. The supply side
(pull-out) causes, namely (i) poverty; (ii) poor
enforcement of the law on compulsory education;
and (iii) illiteracy and ignorance, have not been
adequately addressed. The Education Department
has no mechanism for addressing issues of poverty
and child labour, which are the main reasons cited
by parents and children for never enrolling or
dropping out of school. The Karnataka Education
Act has no mechanisms or procedures to assist
parents who may be disabled, ill or otherwise
dependent on a child’s income. The Education
Act also offers no solution to the large numbers
of children who migrate with their parents for
employment. There are several new initiatives to
bring working children back to school and they
have been successful, but sustained environmentbuilding activities to dispel the illiteracy and
ignorance that justifies child labour are also
required. Entrenched attitudes, which justify poor
children working for a living, are still common,
even among the elite. The attitude of rationalising
child labour as ‘inevitable’ and a ‘necessary evil’, is
yet to disappear. A large percentage of employers
continue to see their employment of children as a
‘favour’ they are doing to the children and their

families to help them survive. The belief that it
is alright for a poor child to earn full time and
learn for a few hours is held by far too many
people. Therefore, while parents may agree that
education is desirable, they are often unable or
unwilling to send their children to school. The
idea that education should lead to a job in the
organised sector, preferably government, is also
held by many parents. Gender bias that says that

girl children will end up as housewives and need
not be educated means that girls are pulled out
of school to work. Existing child labour laws do
not cover the so-called non-hazardous sectors,
such as agriculture, domestic and home-based
work and the informal sector, where more than
90 per cent of children work3. There is, thus, a
contradiction between the law on compulsory
education and the child labour law. There are
also contradictions between these two laws on
the magnitude of punishments for employers of
children. There are currently no inspectors under
the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of
1976, and hence, hardly any identifications of,
and punishment for, practising child bonded
labour. The Children (Pledging of Labour) Act of
1933 is also rarely invoked for freeing pledged
children even though pledging and bondage of
children are very common practices. The Action
Plan on Child Labour has remained a broad policy
document and a ‘statement of intent’. It needs to

be disaggregated into action points with concrete
physical and financial targets on a priority basis.

Targets for poverty reduction:
Tenth Five Year Plan
Karnataka is committed to the Millennium
Development Goals as well as theTenth Plan goals.
One of these goals is to reduce income poverty by
50 per cent between 1990 and 2015. The Tenth
Five Year Plan has been formulated keeping this
goal in mind. The Tenth Plan seeks to bring down
poverty in Karnataka to 7.85 per cent by the year
2007 (Table 4.14).

Employment
The employment scenario can be examined
from different angles, depending upon the policy
perspective and emphasis. For instance, the size
distribution of the workforce across age groups
throws light on the size of child labour force
and its policy imperatives. Data on the mode of
employment highlights policy implications for
social security, particularly for the vulnerable,
casual labour. A profile of the sectoral distribution
of the workforce is critical for an assessment of
the relative importance of various employment
opportunities.

Work participation rate
With the growth in population, there has been
an increase in the work participation rate in the
economy. The work participation rate increased
from 40.2 per cent in 1981 to 42 per cent in
1991 and 44.6 per cent in 2001. As a result, the
workforce too has increased from 14.95 million
in 1981 to 18.89 million in 1991 (an increase of

The increase in the total
work participation rate
occurred largely because
of the increase in female
work participation.

However, the composition of women workers
across different economic activities reveals more
or less similar trends for both SCs, STs and all
groups. Out of total cultivators, the proportion
of women workers is about 30 per cent. SC
and ST women as a proportion of SC and ST
cultivators exhibit the same pattern. About 55
to 60 per cent of total agricultural labourers are
women, both for all groups and SCs/STs, and
among those engaged in household industries,
about 60 per cent are women. Women’s work
participation is high in activities relating to
agro-based manual work and household
industrial activities requiring low skills. The
proportion of SCs and STs in the total ‘other
workers’, which includes high-end jobs of the
tertiary sector and manufacturing sector, is 14.0
and 4.0 per cent respectively. The proportion of
women as a proportion of the total number of
SC and ST workers is about 28 per cent, which
is significantly higher than women workers
as a proportion of the total ‘other workers’
(22 per cent). SC and ST women’s participation
as a proportion of total SC and ST workers in
the ‘other workers category’ is also significantly
higher than the total women workers under this
category.

2.64 per cent per annum) and to 23.52 million
in 2001 (2.45 per cent per annum) (Table 4.15).
The increase in the total work participation rate
occurred largely because of the increase in female
work participation.

Work participation rates by social
groups
The 2001 census provides data on SC and ST
workers by broad category of activities. According
to available data, 16.85 per cent of the total
workers (main + marginal) are SCs and 7.27
per cent are STs. A category-wise comparison
shows that out of total cultivators, SCs constitute
nearly 12 per cent and STs 7.6 per cent. The
proportion of SC agricultural labourers is about 28
per cent and that of STs, about 12 per cent (Table
4.16). This indicates that SC and ST workers are
found predominantly in the agrarian sector where
they cluster in low-end jobs.
Women’s work participation rate
A comparison of work participation by women
(both general and among SCs and STs) shows
that participation among SC and ST women,
at about 41 per cent, is higher than women’s
work participation for all groups (35 per cent).

Given the trend of the movement of the workforce
towards the non-agricultural sector and the
monetisation of the economy, it is important
to examine the forms of employment and the
changes therein over time. Self-employment in
rural Karnataka declined from 55.93 per cent in
1983 to 50.20 per cent in 1999-2000. Regular
salaried jobs have increased in both rural and
urban Karnataka. The proportion of the rural
workforce employed as casual labour was not only
high at 38.8 per cent in 1983, but also increased
further, to 44.50 per cent by 1999-2000
(Table 4.17).
The proportion of marginal labour in the total
workforce is increasing steadily. The share of
marginal workers as a proportion of the total
workers in 1991 was 8.4 per cent, which
increased to 17.7 per cent in 2001. A decline
can be seen in the proportion of main workers
and a significant increase in the proportion of
marginal workers in all southern states and at
the all-India level (Table 4.18).
Over the years the average size of operational
holdings has been steadily declining, which
indirectly shows that net addition to the number of
marginal workers is increasing, particularly in the
farm sector. The quinquennial agricultural census
carried out by the Department of Economics
and Statistics shows that the average size of
operational holdings in Karnataka in 1970-71
was 3.20 ha., which has declined to 2.13 ha in
1991 and 1.74 ha in 2000-01. This casualisation

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

of labour reveals the increasing inability of the
market to provide full-time employment.

Organised and unorganised sector
employment
Organised sector employment, comprising public
and private sector employment, has registered
a negative rate of growth. Total organised sector
employment in Karnataka was 18.80 lakh in the
year 2000-01 and declined to 18.18 lakh by
the end of November 2004. There is no readily
available data on unorganised sector employment.
The 55th round NSS data for 1999-2000 provides
estimated employment for different sectors.
If one takes out the corresponding share of
organised sector employment from the aggregate
employment, one can arrive at an estimate of the
proportion of unorganised sector employment
in the state. Unorganised sector employment
contributes to nearly 92 per cent of aggregate
employment. The share of organised sector
employment is not only small, but also declining,
resulting in greater dependency on unorganised
sector employment. This unhealthy trend holds
true, not only for Karnataka, but for the all-India
level as well.

Sectoral growth of employment
In the context of the changes accompanying
the economic reform process, it is important
to examine the pattern of employment growth
across sectors in Karnataka. Two periods of time
will be considered, viz. (i) 1983 to 1993-94 and
(ii) 1993-94 to 1999-2000. In rural Karnataka,
the growth rate of employment in the agricultural
sector as well as trade decelerated during the
second period, and actually became negative for
mining and quarrying, manufacturing, utilities,
and community, social and personal services. The
only sectors wherein the growth rate accelerated
were transport, storage, communication, finance,
insurance and real estate. In sum, the rural
sector as a whole experienced little growth in
employment during the second period.
Urban Karnataka on the other hand, seems to
have sustained its employment growth during
the second period. The growth rates for the two
periods were 2.95 and 2.54 per cent respectively.

Changes in employment patterns over time: Karnataka versus
all-India






A decline in the extent of chronic unemployment (male and female; usual principal status)
in both rural and urban Karnataka; this is confirmed further by estimates adjusted for
subsidiary status employment. The experience was different at the all-India level: the
estimates (adjusted as well as unadjusted) based on the usual status criterion show some
increase in unemployment for male and female in rural all-India, as well as for male in
urban all-India, as against a decrease in female unemployment in urban all-India.
Intermittent unemployment, as indicated by estimates of current weekly status, show a
marginal increase for both male and female in rural Karnataka and a decline for both in
urban Karnataka. At the all-India level, intermittent unemployment increased for both
sexes in the rural sector, increased for males in the urban sector and decreased for females
in the urban sector.
Unemployment by current daily status decreased for rural males, registered a marginal
increase for rural females and declined for both in the urban areas of Karnataka. However,
unemployment by this criterion registered a perceptible increase for both males and
females in rural all-India and for males in urban all-India. At the all-India level, the urban
sector experienced a decline the in female unemployment rate.

Thus, in sum, Karnataka seems to have done relatively better than the rest of the country in
dealing with the unemployment situation during the 1990s.

Employment declined in agriculture, mining and
quarrying, utilities and community, social and
personal services, but registered an increase in
manufacturing, construction, trade, transport,
storage, communication, finance, insurance, real
estate and non-agricultural activities.

Sectoral composition of employment
Agriculture continues to be the major source of
employment in the rural sector. The proportion of
rural workers employed in agriculture (including
animal husbandry, forestry and logging and
fishing) declined from 84.40 per cent in 1983 to
81.90 per cent in 1993-94 and remained at about
the same level thereafter. However, with the urban
sector’s workforce dependence on agriculture
declining, a similar trend is evident in the state
overall. The manufacturing sector, as a source of
employment, has declined in importance in rural
Karnataka but has virtually remained static in
urban Karnataka. Consistent with this profile, the
proportion of Karnataka’s workforce engaged in
non-agriculture, especially in the urban sector,
has increased during the same period. For the
state as a whole, the proportion increased from
89

This broadly reveals that growth in employment
is mainly Bangalore-centric. Bangalore is
supporting a large number of Information
Technology based industries, which generate
high-end, skill-based employment. There
has been a significant increase in marginal
employment in Bangalore as well, mainly due
to construction activities. There is a large influx
of migrant unskilled labourers to Bangalore
resulting in the high growth of marginal workers.
Much of this migration has been triggered by low
growth and recurrent drought in the state. This
phenomenon of employment growth centering
only around Bangalore imposes great stress on
its infrastructure. In recent times the state has
initiated policies to develop growth centres in
other cities as well.

between 1991 and 2001, largely contributed
to by the growth in the number of marginal
workers. The number of main workers increased
at a rate of 12 per cent and marginal workers
by 161.5 per cent during this period. The
growth of employment is highest in Bangalore
Urban district (54.8 per cent), followed by
Dakshina Kannada (27.8 per cent), Dharwad
(27.6 per cent), Koppal (24.9 per cent) and
Mysore and Raichur with about 26 per cent
each. These are the districts where employment
growth is higher than the state average. Across
districts there is significant growth in Bangalore
Urban in terms of main and marginal workers,
whereas the districts of Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga
and Raichur have a negative rate of growth for
main workers. All these districts are located in
north Karnataka.

The extent of unemployment will be examined
from different perspectives, viz. (i) usual status;
(ii) current weekly status; and (iii) current daily
status. Estimates of unemployment in Karnataka
corresponding to these three perspectives
are presented separately for male and
female, by sector, for the years 1993-94 and
1999-2000 in Table 4.20. The estimate by the
usual status criterion provides a measure of
chronic unemployment; this estimate adjusted
for (excluding) workers on subsidiary status is

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

called ‘Usual Status Adjusted’. Estimates by
the current weekly status measures current
unemployment (chronic as well as temporary);
and current daily status encompasses chronic
unemployment, temporary unemployment and
under-employment. In other words, among
these measures, the current daily status
estimate would be the most comprehensive
measure. It is an estimate of the average level
of unemployment on a day during the survey
year. It is a comprehensive estimate since it is
based on the unemployed days of the chronically
unemployed, the unemployment days of those
who are usually employed but unemployed
intermittently and the unemployed days of those
who are employed as per the current weekly
status approach. Thus, it takes into account the
unemployed days of even employed persons,
and hence, seasonal unemployment also. The
estimates for the rural and urban areas of
Karnataka and all-India show diverse patterns
of change (Table 4.20).

The Table 4.21 indicates that there was a decline
in the extent of unemployment (male and female)
in both rural and urban Karnataka as against
an increase (male and female) in rural all-India,
(male) in urban all-India and a decrease only
in female unemployment in urban all-India. The
conclusion is that Karnataka seems to have fared
better than India as a whole in dealing with the
unemployment situation.

Policy responses
The Government of Karnataka has explored
many policy options to reduce the deprivation
levels of the population. The policies include
programmes to promote growth and
redistribution. Broadly, the redistributive
strategy seeks to reduce poverty by means of
the following interventions:

Promote asset endowment of the poor by
programmes such as land reforms and
Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana
(SGSY);

Offer direct employment opportunities
through programmes like the Sampoorna
Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) and
Stree Shakti; and

features and achievements of these programmes
in recent years are as follows:

Promote food security through the public
distribution system and subsidised food
grains.

These measures have achieved some success
as reflected in the reduction in the estimates
of poverty over time. However, the reduction in
poverty has not been uniform across districts.
The percentage point reduction in the incidence of
poverty between 1993-94 and 1999-2000 was
much less in northern Karnataka than in the south
and the average for the state (Suryanarayana and
Zaidi, 2002).
One major policy emphasis in recent years has
been on growth in the rural areas by measures
to promote (i) productivity in agriculture and

Various government programmes, including
direct wage employment programmes, such
as Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana,
Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana, departmental
works in irrigation, roads, buildings, command
area development etc. generate considerable
wage employment, which support the
employment needs of the rural sector. The

Concerns












Comparable with all-India trends, Karnataka
is experiencing a structural change in the
composition of its State Domestic Product
with the share of the primary sector declining
in favour of the tertiary sector and the
intermediary secondary sector remaining
almost constant. Employment, however, is
still primary sector oriented, with secondary
and tertiary sectors contributing relatively
lower proportions. Though the economy has
grown at a moderate compound growth rate
of around 6 per cent during the decade, the
growth of the primary sector has increased
only marginally, (by less than one per cent)
and it is the secondary and tertiary sectors
that have fuelled this growth in the state.
Another area of concern is the low
participation of women in the secondary and
tertiary sectors. Women are found largely
in unskilled low-end jobs like agriculture
labour, household industries etc. Women
constitute nearly 60 per cent of agricultural
labourers. There is a disparity in the relative
agricultural wages between men and women
besides disparity in real and nominal wages.
This further pushes women into a poverty
trap.
Karnataka has the second largest percentage
of children living in poor households, rural
and urban, among the four southern states.
While government has initiated many
programmes for child labour, the results
are mixed because the policy focuses on
rehabilitation rather than prevention.
Existing child labour laws do not cover the
so-called non-hazardous sectors such as
agriculture, domestic and home-based work,
and the informal sector, where more than 90
per cent of children work. There is, thus, a
contradiction between the law on compulsory
education which bans all work during school
hours and the child labour law.There are also
contradictions between these two laws on
the magnitude of punishments for employers
of children.
Another area of concern is negative growth
in organised sector employment in recent
years. While the share of the organised sector





in the aggregate employment is very low at
eight per cent, a proportion comparable with
all-India, it will further decline to lower levels
if remedial policy measures are not taken
with appropriate state interventions.
Poverty trends show a declining trend in the
state, comparable with the all-India trend.
However, urban poverty in Karnataka is
higher than the rural poverty levels. One of
the apparent reasons for the high incidence
of urban poverty is migration from the rural
to urban areas for employment.
The large number of agricultural labourers
as a proportion of the total work force
adversely impacts labour productivity,
per capita income and poverty levels due
to an excessive dependence on agriculture.
Inter-district comparisons show that leading
districts such as Bangalore, Kodagu, and
Dakshina Kannada have a low proportion
of agricultural labourers in the aggregate
employment. These districts have high
labour productivity and per capita income,
and a low incidence of poverty. Backward
districts like Raichur, Gulbarga and Haveri
have a high proportion of agricultural
labour but relatively low productivity levels,
per capita income and a high incidence of
poverty.

Recommendations




Formulate a comprehensive employment
strategy aiming at sectoral and regional
diversification; identify appropriate labour
intensive technologies; encourage faster
growth in the primary sector; reduce regional
disparities.
Reorient the employment strategy to absorb
the growing labour force by creating more job
opportunities and a growth strategy focusing
on the primary sector, which can sustain and
absorb the increasing employment needs.
The growth strategy must also focus on
creating employment opportunities in the
non-farm and household industry sectors
which are highly labour intensive.The tertiary
sector though contributing significantly to the
state income, is not labour intensive and is
confined to highly skilled jobs.There is a large

There is a disparity in the
relative agricultural wages
between men and women

Institutional Reforms for Human
Development: Panchayat Raj
Introduction
The Government of Karnataka, as part of its strategy
of promoting human development, has undertaken
several institutional reforms. One area where it
undertook this task early is decentralisation of
governance and planning. Basically, institutional
reform of this kind is a way of ensuring
grassroots participation, greater transparency and
accountability and responsiveness to local needs.
If this combination works, then people are assured
of efficient service delivery and better human
development outcomes.

Evolution of local government
in Karnataka
In the erstwhile princely state of Mysore, the
idea of local self-governance emerged as early
as 1874, with the establishment of ‘local fund
committees’ in each district, for taking up
construction of roads and subsidiary works. But
these committees did not evoke local interest
and initiative because of the dominance of the
official members. The Mysore Local Boards Act of
1902, which sought to correct this shortcoming,
provided for a three-tier local self-government
structure consisting of the village panchayat with a
nominated chairman, a taluk board with the subdivision officer as president and a district board
with the Deputy Commissioner as president. Since
even these measures did not lessen the hold of
the bureaucracy, the Mysore Local Boards and
Village Panchayat Act was enacted in 1918 to
provide for elected members and elected vice
presidents at these levels. In 1926, the Mysore
District and Mysore Village Panchayats Act was
enacted, providing panchayats with adequate
powers, finances and resources, and eliminating
taluk boards from the system. All these measures
were intended to loosen the hold of bureaucrats
and to induct people’s representatives into local
government.

During the early 1950s there were further
attempts to make these institutions people
oriented and more representative. The Mysore
Village Panchayats and Local Boards Act, 1959
was enacted, within the broad framework of
the Balwanthrai Mehta Committee Report, to
provide for village panchayats, taluk development
boards and district development councils. The
first two bodies were wholly elected and the
last was a coordinating body with nominated
members and people’s representatives and district
level government officials. The Panchayat Raj
institutions (PRIs) under the 1959 Act provided
a viable politico-administrative structure, which
had been so far absent.The Act made provision for
reservation for women and the Scheduled Castes
(SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) to the elected
bodies but it did not bestow sufficient attention on
the question of financial autonomy. A field level
study (N. Sivanna, 1990) noted that the system
threw up a power structure, which reflected the
one that obtained in rural Karnataka.
The Ashok Mehta Committee, which submitted
its report in 1978, sought a more comprehensive
role for Panchayat Raj institutions such that
they would ‘undertake democratic development
management under conditions of rapid changes,
continuous growth and sustained innovations in
all spheres of rural life’ (Government of India,
1978:77). The Karnataka Legislature then
enacted the Karnataka Zilla Parishads, Taluk
Panchayat Samithis, Mandal Panchayats and
Nyaya Panchayats Act in 1983, which established
a new PR structure consisting of mandal
panchayats at the village level, taluk panchayat
samithis and zilla parishads. These institutions
apart, the Act provided for a gram sabha (village
assembly) which comprised all eligible voters of
a given mandal panchayat, panchayat members
and government officers who were expected

Decentralisation of
governance and planning
is a way of ensuring
grassroots participation,
greater transparency
and accountability and
responsiveness to local
needs. If this combination
works, then people are
assured of efficient service
delivery and better human
development outcomes.

to use the forum to (i) discuss and review all
development problems and programmes of the
village; (ii) select beneficiaries for beneficiary
oriented programmes; and (iii) plan for the
development of the village economy and its
people which included minimum needs, welfare
and production oriented activities. The gram
sabha was conceived as a space that provided an
opportunity to the people to voice their needs and
aspirations; it was also to be a platform where
the elected representatives and the bureaucrats
were made accountable to the people for their
actions and to serve as a means of ensuring
transparency in administration.

The gram sabha was
conceived as a space
that provided an

aspirations; it was also to
be a platform where the
elected representatives
and the bureaucrats were
made accountable to the
people for their actions
and to serve as a means
of ensuring transparency
in administration.

The decentralised system that was put in place
under the 1983 Act was really radical, in the
sense, that many powers were devolved to the
people to govern themselves and to promote
local development. It made the PR bureaucracy
accountable to the people’s representatives,
rather than the state bureaucracy. There
was substantial reservation for women and
backward classes. People’s participation in local
government was enabled by holding gram sabhas,
which were mandatorily convened twice a year.
Here the citizens reviewed the activities of the
mandal governments, selected the beneficiaries
under various anti-poverty programmes and
development projects, and made decisions
about project selection and community
participation.
Studies on the performance of these PRIs,
identified certain shortcomings. While the
reservation policy gave women, the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes and backward
castes representation in local bodies, they did not
occupy positions of leadership such as Pradhan in
the mandal panchayat or Adhyaksha of the zilla
parishad. Members of the dominant communities
wrested these positions due to their control of
rural society (Amal Ray and K. Jayalakshmi,
October, 1987; A. Aziz, 1994). Second, with the
assigning of the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana funds
and with improved revenue collections the PRIs’
financial status improved, but they still suffered
from lack of financial autonomy because they
continued to depend overwhelmingly on grants

256

from the state government. The quantum of
discretionary grants available to them was
minimal. Third, the panchayats did better in
some areas than in others. The evaluation
committee which reviewed the performance of
PRIs testified to the good performance of PRIs,
(Government of Karnataka, 1989) whereas
other studies showed that most of the projects
implemented were construction oriented; i.e. the
construction of, and repairs to, buildings, roads,
bridges, rather than production oriented (A. Aziz,
1993; A. Aziz, 1994; and Planning Department,
Government of Karnataka, 1987). Finally,
the PR bodies did not have any constitutional
safeguards or permanence. Consequently, with
the completion of the first five-year term in
January 1992, elections to these institutions
were not held; instead, they were superseded
and administrators appointed to carry out the
functions of the PRIs. The 73rd Amendment to
the Constitution gave constitutional guarantees
to PRIs of elections, guarantees against the state
superseding Panchayat Raj (PR) bodies, seat
and authority position reservation for the weaker
sections, financial devolution on a scientific basis,
and so on. Following this, many states, including
Karnataka, passed new Panchayat Raj Acts
conforming to the provisions of the Constitution
Amendment Act.

The current scenario
Attempts have been made in recent times
to strengthen PRIs by adopting measures to
promote good governance and accountability
through ‘enhanced people’s participation, citizen
orientation, responsiveness, improved service
delivery, improved financial management and
greater downward accountability’ (RDPR,
Government of Karnataka, 17.5.2004). The
Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993 was amended
in October 2003 and the 47 amendments thus
effected were intended to facilitate people’s
participation and to make PRIs more accountable
to their constituents. Conceptually, gram sabhas
provide a space for grassroots participation. In
reality, their functioning has often been neither
democratic nor participatory. The poor, women,
the SCs and STs remained marginalised and
voiceless.

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

To ensure greater and more effective participation,
the amendments provide for the ward/vasathi
sabha in each constituency of the gram panchayat
(GP) with mandatory powers to identify and
prioritise beneficiaries, approve development
plans, generate project proposals, and identify
deficiencies in rural amenities.
A significant step taken in the direction of carrying
decentralisation forward is the Belur Declaration
adopted in January 2004.This declaration lists the
steps to be taken by the authorities concerned to
strengthen the gram panchayat by appropriately
devolving powers, functions and funds, by
equipping them with technical and managerial
capabilities and by ensuring transparency and
accountability in its functions.
Karnataka is ahead of many states in terms
of the powers and functions that have been
delegated to PRIs. An analysis will reveal the
extent to which the PRIs have managed delivery
systems efficiently; ensured transparency and
accountability; and taken decision-making
to the grassroots. The following aspects of
decentralisation will be examined: (i) devolution
of powers, functions, functionaries and funds;
(ii) creation of a participatory environment through
reservation of seats and authority positions;
(iii) community participation especially
participation of people’s organisations and
NGOs; and (iv) decentralised governance and
planning.
Under the 1993 Act, the panchayats shall
function in accordance with the principle that
what is appropriate at a given level should not
be done at a higher level. The 29 functions listed
in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution, and
devolved to panchayats were delineated in three
separate schedules, each of which was applicable
to the gram panchayat (GP), taluk panchayat (TP)
and zilla panchayat (ZP) respectively.The functions
include preparation of annual plans and annual
budgets; preparation of sectoral development
schemes to promote agriculture, animal
husbandry, rural housing, drinking water, roads
and bridges, rural electrification, education, public
health, sanitation, women and child development,

BOX 11.1

Imparting transparency and accountability in PRI functioning
Certain other provisions impart greater transparency and accountability to the functioning of
PRIs: (i) TP and ZP members must declare their assets and furnish accounts of election expenses;
(ii) all panchayat members must disclose their pecuniary interest, if any, in panchayat dealings;
(iii) meeting proceedings must be displayed within 72 hours on the GP notice board along with
the names of members voting for or against the resolutions passed; (iv) all panchayats must
make available details of works undertaken and expenditures incurred, receipts of funds etc;
(v) bills of works undertaken in the GP area by TPs and ZPs will be cleared only after the GP
concerned certifies that the works have been satisfactorily completed; and (vi) attendance of
officials at GP meetings is mandatory.

social welfare, maintenance of community assets,
promotion of libraries and so on. More powers
and functions were devolved in 2004-05 and
in order to remove ambiguity, a detailed activity
map was prepared for each of the three panchayat
tiers. Certain distortions and ambiguities noticed
at the implementation level were sought to be
removed by rationalising or merging schemes.
Such rationalisation has resulted in the reduction
of schemes from 421 to 217.This means that PRIs
are now less constrained and straitjacketed by the
normal plethora of department schemes, each
with a set of inflexible guidelines that clamped a
tight hold on expenditure and left little room for
innovation or flexibility.

Principles of fiscal devolution
Since the decentralised governments are
required to perform several devolved functions,
and perform those functions efficiently, the
funds devolved to them ought also to be
adequate. Under Article 243-1 of the 73rd
Constitution Amendment Act, the State
Finance Commissions (SFCs) are empowered
to determine the quantum of state resources
to be devolved to panchayats and urban local
governments. Theoretically speaking, transfer
of resources from the state government to
decentralised governments can take two forms:
general purpose and specific purpose grants.
The former is meant to offset fiscal disabilities
arising from inabilities to locally raise adequate
resources to provide the needed infrastructure
at levels compared to those in richer regions,
so as to utilise the growth potential available

PRIs are now less
constrained and

While the state
government broadly
accepted the first SFC
recommendations on
the quantum of funds
devolution to panchayats,
it did not do so with
regard to the allocation
criteria and continued to
follow the modified Gadgil
formula, on the ground
that the latter was better
placed for ensuring social
justice.

in the poorer regions and to promote higher
growth rates there. On the other hand, the
specific purpose grants are meant to ensure
that categorical equity or ‘wealth neutral’
services (unrelated to ability to pay) such as
education, health and sanitation, rural roads
etc. are provided in adequate quantities
(M. Govinda Rao). The First Karnataka State
Finance Commission arrived at a figure of
36 per cent of the non-plan gross own
revenue receipts of the state government to
be devolved to panchayats and urban local
self-governments (Government of Karnataka,
January 1996). This is an improvement over
the 34.3 per cent in vogue and amounted to
Rs.2,675 crore during 1996-97. The Second
Karnataka State Finance Commission hiked this
figure to 40 per cent. As for sharing this amount
between panchayats and urban local bodies
(ULBs) the First Commission recommended a
share of 30.4 per cent to the former and 5.6
per cent to the latter; the recommendation of
the Second Commission was 32 per cent and
8 per cent respectively. As for the allocation of
this amount across different tiers of panchayats,
the Commission recommended a ratio of
40:35:25 to zilla panchayats, taluk panchayats
and gram panchayats respectively. Under this
allocation scheme, gram panchayats would
have gained greatly because the proportion
going to them at that time was estimated to
be only 13 per cent of the devolved funds. The
criteria and the weightage suggested by the
First Commission for allocating funds across
panchayats within each tier were: population
(33.3 per cent), area (33.3 per cent), and
backwardness seen in terms of road length,
hospital beds and illiteracy (33.3 per cent). This
formula marked a departure from the modified
Gadgil formula followed since 1987, when
the Commission introduced a new criterion in
the form of area in addition to population and
backwardness. The Second Commission, while
retaining those criteria, replaced roads by the
proportion of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled
Tribe population under the third criterion. The
allocative formula was changed to 30 per cent
each to the first two criteria and to 40 per cent
for backwardness. Incidentally, while the state

government broadly accepted the first SFC
recommendations on the quantum of funds
devolution to panchayats, it did not do so with
regard to the allocation criteria and continued
to follow the modified Gadgil formula, on the
ground that the latter was better placed for
ensuring social justice.

Human development and fiscal
devolution
An analysis of fiscal decentralisation in
Karnataka by Rao, Amar Nath and Vani
(2004)1 identifies certain features of fiscal
decentralisation to rural local governments that
impact on human development expenditures.
Formally, Karnataka has transferred all the
functions listed in the schedule to the local
governments, but several are exercised
concurrently with the state government. The
Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, 1993 lists 31
functional items to gram panchayats, 28 items
to taluk panchayats and 29 items to zilla
panchayats. The actual assignment, however,
involved transferring a number of schemes
included in the plan – to constitute the
‘District Sector’ plans – to ZPs, TPs and GPs
for implementation. The employees of various
line departments in the state were transferred
to the district sector to implement these
programmes. To ensure that they continue
to enjoy the same powers and to undertake
the same functions, the expenditure functions
were devolved in terms of schemes, with the
condition that the local governments could
not scrap any of the schemes, and salary was
given priority in expenditure implementation.
In terms of adequacy and reach, the volume of
spending assigned to rural local governments
continues to be low. While the state government
has transferred the functions and the functionaries
to panchayats, the hardening fiscal situation
has restricted the devolution of funds. Based

Decentralisation to Rural Governments in India, the World Bank,
Oxford University Press.

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

on the information in the Link Document2, the
estimated expenditure by panchayats was 21.8
per cent of the state’s expenditures or about
5 per cent of GSDP in 2001-02. Of this, an
overwhelming proportion was incurred for nonplan purposes. Plan expenditure was estimated
at 38 per cent in 2001-02 and was lower at
27.4 per cent in 2002-03. In most sectors, the
resources were just adequate to pay the salaries
of the employees and the greatest proportion of
expenditures at panchayat level was accounted
for by spillover schemes from the previous plans
and other salary and maintenance expenditures.
Furthermore, the role of the grassroot tier – the
GP - was negligible. Allocation to GPs constituted
just about five per cent of total district sector
outlays and a little over one per cent of state
outlay. This changed only in 2005, when many
schemes were delegated to gram panchayats.
The distribution of resources across different
districts is not based on actual needs. It must be
noted that a significant proportion of assigned
functions to the rural local governments relates to
human development. As functions, functionaries
and finances are devolved in terms of various
schemes, the distribution of funds to various
districts is not based on the requirements, but
is historically pre-determined and those districts
with good infrastructure and have big budgets

continue to receive higher transfers. There is little
scope, in this pattern, to focus on the deprived
districts in allocating resources. This has resulted
in the persistence of sharp variations in human
development outcomes among different districts.
Devolution to local bodies is the easiest component
of expenditure compression.The state government
has tried to contain the expenditure growth under
the fiscal adjustment programmes initiated in
2002-03, mainly by restricting plan expenditures.
As a result, the share of plan allocation by rural
local governments in total state expenditures was
reduced from 8.3 per cent in 2001-02 to 5.1 per
cent in 2002-03 and the share of plan allocation
to rural local bodies in the state’s Annual Plan
outlay declined from 27.8 per cent to 18.1 per
cent during the year. In fact, the district sector
plan outlay declined throughout the 1990s, from
2.5 per cent of GSDP in 1990-91 to 1.6 per cent
in 2001-02. As a ratio of total state expenditure,
the decline was from 40 per cent to 18 per cent
during the period (Figure 11.1). Thus, there has
been a steady erosion in the assistance given
to rural local governments for developmental
spending during the last decade, which was
reversed only in 2005-06.

The Achilles’ heel of
decentralised government
is taxation. Decentralised
governmental units, on
their part, have not taken
a proactive role, either
in raising the resources
to increase allocation to
social sector expenditures,
or in increasing the
effectiveness of spending
programmes by improving
the delivery systems.

schemes on the one hand, and concentration
of outlay in only a few schemes on the other.
Although there were over 371 plan and
228 non-plan schemes in 2001-02, only a
handful of schemes contributed to the bulk
of expenditures. Among the state sector plan
schemes implemented in TPs, the pre-school
children feeding programme was the most
important. On the non-plan side, disbursement
of school teachers’ salaries and providing grants
to schools accounted for 80 per cent of the nonplan outlay in TPs. In the ZPs too, a handful
of schemes were important. On the plan side,
piped water supply, family welfare centres and
PHCs, SGRY, SGSY, rural sub-centres for family
welfare and DPAP accounted for 55 per cent of
the plan outlay on Central schemes in 200203. On the non-plan side, grants disbursed to
the non-government secondary schools alone
accounted for about a third of expenditures in
the ZPs.

Discretionary funds
Does rural fiscal decentralisation in Karnataka
empower local governments to provide public
services according to the preferences of their
residents? The disaggregated analysis of the
outlay on 30 major schemes implemented
by the rural local governments shows that
they hardly have any leeway or autonomy
in determining their allocation priorities. Of
the total outlay, 58 per cent is earmarked for
salaries, 11 per cent is simply transferred as
grants-in-aid to institutions and 10 per cent is
required to be spent on transfer payments to
persons. Another 16 per cent is earmarked for
specified schemes. This leaves the panchayats
absolute discretion over only five per cent of
the outlay. In respect of another 16 per cent
of the outlay, they have limited autonomy.
However, here too, the panchayats have the
choice to determine the allocation between
various input purchases within the schemes,
but cannot change total allocation from the
scheme. This suggests that the nature of fiscal
decentralisation will have to change to enable
PRIs to address area-specific needs in a more
focused way.

The general complaint of the panchayat leaders,
especially in GPs, is that the funds devolved are
not commensurate with the needs of the people
and monies sanctioned to them are not released in
time to carry out development works. Untied grants
to GPs have increased significantly over the years.
Gram panchayats were initially given an annual
grant of Rs.1,00,000 in 1993, Rs.2,00,000 in
1999, Rs.3,50,000 in 2000, which was raised to
Rs.5,00,000 in 2003. At present, they continue
to get grants from the Centre under SGRY and
under the Eleventh National Finance Commission
recommendations. Now this grant comes to about
Rs.7,50,000 per annum per gram panchayat
and will increase in 2005, with more schemes
being delegated to PRIs. In 2005-06, the District
Sector Plan outlay shot up to Rs.2,002.89 crore
from Rs.939.71 crore in 2004-05. The state
government now directly releases its grants to the
gram panchayats through banks, which makes the
releases transparent and less liable to leak during
transmission.3 Rationalisation of schemes and
transfer of more schemes to PRIs will offer more
autonomy to PRIs.

Gram panchayats and resource
mobilisation
The Achilles’ heel of decentralised government is
taxation. Decentralised governmental units, on
their part, have not taken a proactive role, either
in raising the resources to increase allocation
to social sector expenditures, or in increasing
the effectiveness of spending programmes by
improving the delivery systems. The ZPs and
TPs do not have revenue-raising powers and
they function as de-concentrated agencies of
the state government in disbursing the salaries
of teachers and health workers. At the same
time, the GPs spend just about six per cent of
the total expenditures incurred by the rural local
governments, and thus, have a negligible role in
providing social services impacting on human
development. To be sure, they play some role in
water supply and sanitation and in implementing
the SGRY, but the resources available with the GPs
3

Surprisingly, when the Centre decided to directly release its
grants to panchayats some state governments opposed the
move!

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

for water supply are meagre and in the poorer
districts of northern Karnataka, which also have
water scarcity, the problem is acute. Their inability
to raise resources from the sources assigned to
them adds to the problem of inadequate resource
transfer from the state government. The GPs
implement 50 per cent of the outlay on SGRY, and
to that extent, they play their part in implementing
poverty alleviation programmes.
One reason for the relatively minor role of rural
local governments in human development is
their poor record of raising revenues from own
sources.The ZPs and TPs do not have independent
revenue raising powers, so they merely implement
the schemes designed by the state or the Central
government. Only the GPs have revenue raising
powers, but in 2000-01, they raised only
Rs.16.2 crore, or 0.08 per cent of the Gross
District Domestic Product (GDDP), which in turn,
constituted 22 per cent of the total revenues of
the GPs. The taxes and rates assigned to gram
panchayats are house tax, non-motorable vehicle
tax, factory tax, entertainment tax other than
cinema halls, water tax, licence fee, fee on fairs,
and so on. Except property tax, the other taxes
assigned are not productive, nor are they elastic;

and the panchayats are too close to the people
to be able to collect taxes and rates efficiently.
Both the design and implementation of property
tax need to be improved. Though potentially
lucrative, the tax suffers from a poor and outdated
valuation system and the GPs do not have the
administrative or enforcement capacity to raise
significant revenues from the tax. GPs have been
able to collect only 69 per cent of the amount due
and the cost of collection of the tax is estimated
at 72 per cent. In as many as 42 per cent of the
panchayats, the cost of tax collection was found to
be higher than the revenue collected. A significant
effort will have to be made to strengthen the
administrative and enforcement capacity of the
GPs to raise more revenues from the sources
assigned to them, to enable these grassroot level
governments to play a meaningful role in human
development.
The state government took certain initiatives in
2003 to help gram panchayats: (i) guidelines
standardising rules for collection of property tax
were issued; (ii) a process was set in motion for
evaluation of tax that was transparent, and allowed
people to participate in the tax determination
process; (iii) property lists were publicised and

Only the GPs have revenue
raising powers, but in
2000-01, they raised only
Rs.16.2 crore, or
0.08 per cent of the Gross
District Domestic Product,
which in turn, constituted
22 per cent of the total
revenues of the GPs.

put on the GP notice board for inspection. The
outcome of this initiative was that there was a
30 per cent increase in the number of properties
enumerated and the GP tax demand more than
doubled from Rs.80.6 crore to Rs.197.5 crore
(RDPR, Government of Karnataka, 17.5.2004:
8). It is now the turn of the gram panchayats to
improve tax mobilisation.

The state has been
implementing social
legislations and
development programmes
for equity and social
justice for decades, but
their effectiveness and
reach were affected by the
fact that the poor and the
vulnerable did not have
access to political power.

Table 11.1 depicts the actual picture of the
resource mobilisation of the Panchayat Raj
institutions that existed in 1997-98, based on the
data of the Eleventh Finance Commission. Perhaps
one may even hypothesise that mobilisation of
resources would be more effective since the local
governments are closer to people, but the actual
picture is something different. The revenue that
comes from taxes and other sources is only 3.5
per cent at the all-India level. For Karnataka it is
only 0.8 per cent. Among the states, Punjab has a
high proportion (39.8) of tax & non tax revenue,
perhaps because of the small size of resources, i.e.
only Rs.135 crore.

The social base of governance
The state has been implementing social legislations
and development programmes for equity and

social justice for decades, but their effectiveness
and reach were affected by the fact that the poor
and the vulnerable did not have access to political
power. It is now recognised that the marginalised
and the poor must have access to various political
fora to articulate their problems and grievances.
Participation in a grassroots political process is
likely to provide greater opportunities to such
persons to aspire to political power and authority,
through which they can also upgrade the social
and economic status of other members of their
caste/gender.
Political representation to the disadvantaged
castes such as the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes has been guaranteed by the
principle of ‘reservation’. However, there was
no representation for the backward castes
and women until the 1983 Act addressed that
need, by providing reservation in seats and
authority positions, not only to SCs and STs,
but also to women and backward castes. The
seat and authority position matrix is: (i) for SCs
and STs in proportion to their population or a
minimum of 18 per cent, (ii) 33.3 per cent for
other backward castes, and, more significantly,
(iii) one third for women from each of these

castes, including the non-reserved seats. This
measure has roped in a large number of men
and women from the various deprived caste
groups, and, has thereby, widened the social
base of governance in rural as well as urban
society. Thus, in respect of panchayats, well
over 60 per cent of the membership comprises
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other
backward castes. Women’s representation is
considerably higher, exceeding their quota of
reservation. The elections held in 2000 returned
44.9 per cent, 42.2 per cent and 38.9 per cent
of women in GPs, TPs and ZPs respectively
(Table 11.3).
It is noteworthy that the proportion of these
sections increases as one moves down from the
upper to the lower tiers of panchayats, which
is appropriate, considering that these sections
participate more actively in the lower governance
levels, where decision-making on the public
service delivery takes place more intensively.
This system of reservation has brought into the
local governance system a large proportion of first
time/first generation representatives from hitherto
unrepresented social groups. Though this is a
welcome development, it has meant that certain
gender and caste stereotypes have become visible
and are seen quite wrongly as ‘constraints’. One
such stereotype is that ‘women are alien to politics
and governance’. The ‘belief’ represents no truth,
only the reluctance of existing power structures
to acknowledge and welcome social and political
restructuring in the wake of the 1983 and 1993
Acts. The reservation of seats and authority
positions to various social groups has widened
the social base of political decision-making at the
decentralised governance level, thus, promoting
participatory governance.

People’s participation in
decision-making
The Act provides all the mechanisms necessary
to ensure that the bodies are representative and
their functioning is participatory. Good governance
would imply, among other things, an efficient
delivery system; one, which is responsive to the
needs and aspirations of citizens and addresses
these needs with the least amount of leakage.

The question that arises next is about the kind
of needs and programmes that are identified, and
implemented. A study4 has found that projects can
be grouped in three categories, viz. (i) social and
economic infrastructure projects such as school and
hospital buildings, roads, bridges, irrigation tanks,
and so on; (ii) civic amenities such as drinking
water, drainage and street lights, community
buildings, bus shelters and shopping centres; and
(iii) sectoral development projects, such as projects
that promote agriculture, forestry, village industries,
horticulture etc. Amenities take priority because of
public demand. However, the preferred projects are
construction oriented such as buildings, culverts
and roads. Sectoral development projects and
industries have not received adequate attention
from PRIs. Explanations offered by Panchayat Raj
functionaries for their preference for construction
oriented projects are: (i) these are the projects
which the people themselves ask for and (ii) the
panchayats must show ‘visible’ evidence of having
met people’s needs, and hence, construction takes
precedence over projects with long gestation
periods or less visible outcomes such as capacity
building. Construction projects lend themselves to
leakage and there are reports of PRI members who
have become contractors and bid for contracts.

Reservation has
brought into the local
governance system a
large proportion of first
time/first generation
representatives from
hitherto unrepresented
social groups.

Granting that corruption does obtain under the
decentralised government system – and there
seems to be no evidence to the contrary – is it still

more cost efficient compared to the centralised
governance system? One writer says that it is more
expensive because the decentralised governance
system fails to internalise the negative externality
of one bribe transaction on another because of
two reasons: (i) there is absence of social audit
by people and their organisations; and (ii) the
interlocking social and economic relationships
that obtain in rural society, and the existence of
small proximate groups in the villages, enable
the panchayat functionaries to easily manage
the risk of being caught (P. Bardhan, 1996). The
Government intends to address some of these
issues by establishing offices of Ombudsmen in the
districts and strengthening the public grievance
machinery.

food grains under the programme and this has
augmented the funds available to the GPs and
increased their capacity to plan; (ii) the Swachha
Grama programme launched in April 2001 with
90 per cent government funding, which has
enabled GPs to prioritise rural sanitation which
is inadequate in all villages; (iii) the Jal Nirmal
programme (June 2002) with 85 per cent
state funding is GP-centric from concept to
execution; (iv) the Jalasamrakshana programme
(August 2002), a cost sharing project between
the state and the beneficiary, managed by the
GP; (v) under the Sarva Kutumba Sameekshe
(November 2003), GPs conducted a house-tohouse survey and created a database that will
be useful for monitoring human development
indicators.

Decentralised planning
The primary objective of decentralised planning
by PRIs is the promotion of rural development by
identifying local needs and prioritising activities.
Institutional support for local level planning,
such as district level planning units and the basic
guidelines for carrying out planning activities
have been provided. The taluk panchayats and
gram panchayats have no institutional support
for planning and monitoring, and this should be
provided as early as possible.
The Central and state governments have taken
many initiatives to strengthen planning at the
grassroot level. They are: (i) the merger of JGSY
and EAS to create SGRY. The cash allocation
is supplemented by an equivalent quantity of
BOX 11.2

Evaluation of Panchayat Raj system
The National Eleventh Finance Commission has evaluated the Panchayat Raj system in the
country by using ten parameters and constructing an index of decentralisation. The parameters
used in the construction of the index of decentralisation are: (i) enactment/amendment of state
panchayat/municipal legislation; (ii) intervention/restriction in the functioning of the local bodies;
assignment of functions to the local bodies by state legislation; (iii) actual transfer of functions
to these bodies by way of rules, notifications and orders; (iv) assignment of powers of taxation
to local bodies and the extent of exercise of such powers; (v) constitution of the State Finance
Commissions and the extent of action taken on their reports; (vi) election to the local bodies; and
(vii) constitution of District Planning Committees. In terms of these parameters, Karnataka ranks
among the top states in the country.

264

These recent initiatives by the state will
undoubtedly augment the funds available to gram
panchayats and strengthen their capacity to plan at
the grassroot level; especially since planning and
implementation have been a mixed experience so
far. Often, inputs for planning are not obtained
from the people, and it is the panchayat members
and officials who supply inputs in the gram sabha
meetings. Consequently, development plans
prepared by the panchayats turn out to be plans
made by officials and members for the people,
and not plans of the people prepared by the
people. Some panchayats have ensured people’s
participation at the stage of implementation of
projects through special committees, and projects
are completed efficiently and in time. In other
panchayats, where people are not involved,
implementation of projects is inefficient and not
cost-effective.
The District Sector Plan is supposed to be a
blend of plans emanating from Panchayat
Raj institutions and urban local bodies. The
integration of plans from all the tiers does not
always result in a seamless document, and
instead, a jumble of projects with no time or
project connectivity is produced. District Planning
Committees need capacity building if they are to
function effectively as nodal planning agencies
at the district level.

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

Further, there is a need to ensure that the
planning process is free from any kind of state
intervention. In fact, with a view to making it
more relevant and strong, the Working Group on
Decentralisation (March 2002) holds the view
that the planning process should move away
from sectoral planning to a system of integrated
area planning.

PRIs and civil society
Owing to the critical problems associated with the
public service delivery system such as inefficiency,
poor resources, and lack of adequate citizen
participation there has emerged a consensus for
public-private partnership to promote an efficient
and effective service delivery system. This has
brought into focus the institution of civil society,
which is supposed to demand better performance
and accountability, and monitor public service
provisioning.
The term ‘civil society’ embraces a large number
of institutions outside the state, such as capitalist
market institutions, religious institutions, private
and public associations, all forms of cooperative
social relationships, and political parties (C. Jeffry
Alexander, 1998). We will look at only a few aspects
of civil society, which can have a meaningful
interface with decentralised governments such
as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and
community based organisations (CBOs). These
institutions/organisations have the potential to
support and strengthen decentralised governments
and work with them as partners. They can play a
role in revitalising decentralised governments at
three levels: motivating people to participate in the
decision-making process, providing information
to people on various aspects of local government
and planning, and providing inputs on attitudinal
changes, for example, with regard to reservations
for weaker sections. They can provide inputs to
both elected members and the bureaucracy (Abdul
Aziz, 1999).
A three-state study covering Karnataka, Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu holds the view that NGOs
and CBOs had no role at all in PRI functioning or
implementation. The NGO-panchayat partnership
did not flower because of mutual suspicion about

motives. As for people’s organisations such as
Mahila Mandals and youth clubs, the study notes
that they ‘hardly find a common ground to work
with panchayats. Both of them are content with
organising sports and cultural activities during
national and state festivals taking financial
assistance from panchayats’ (Abdul Aziz, 2002).
A different perspective does exist, however. One
writer says ‘The NGOs in Karnataka were dubious
towards the new decentralised political structure
in the beginning (they however) were forced to
redefine their rules because PRIs have become
part of the structure within which NGOs have to
work, and structural changes in PRIs are aimed at
people-centered rural development, which is also
the objective of many of the NGOs’ (Susanne Dam
Hansen, 1999: 79-80). As part of this change,
NGOs in Karnataka are reported to have supported
PRIs, both during pre- and post-election periods.
During the pre-election period they have enabled
women and the underprivileged to contest
elections and provided them with moral support.
During the post-election period, they have
promoted capacity building among marginalised
people by giving them formal training (Susanne
Dam Hansen, 1999: Alex Tuscano, 1999.
It is clear that though civil society has immense
potential to work as a partner with local bodies,
so far it has played a limited role in terms of
interacting with PRIs. This could, in part, be
due to the reluctance of NGOs and people’s
organisations to work with the local leadership
on the one hand and the cautious attitude
of the panchayat functionaries towards the
intentions of certain civil society organisations
on the other.

NGOs and CBOs have the
potential to support and
strengthen decentralised
governments and work
with them as partners.
They can play a role in
revitalising decentralised
governments at three
levels: motivating people
to participate in the
decision-making process,
providing information to
people on various aspects
of local government and
planning, and providing
inputs on attitudinal
changes.

Conclusions
The PRI system has been steadily evolving in the
state and there are constant efforts to ensure that
the powers of the Panchayat Raj bodies are not
eroded and more functions are devolved to them
in accordance with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution. Constraints that prevent PRIs from
optimising their performance have been discussed
above. However, even given these constraints, PRIs
have not prioritised human development goals in
265

PRIs have not prioritised
human development
goals in their wish lists.
More capacity building,

their wish lists. More capacity building, inclusion
of human development goals in district sector
plans backed by funds and sustained monitoring
of HD objectives would contribute significantly
to improving HD outcomes, in north Karnataka
in particular. The new arena of intervention is
the village, and gram panchayats have created
formidable databases that will underpin HD
planning and monitoring at the grassroots. Gram
panchayats are perfectly positioned to ensure that
all children remain in school and that all births are
institutional births. Such initiatives could improve
literacy rates, and reduce IMR and MMR very
visibly. The state’s role should be primarily, as a
resource centre, rather than an enforcer. In that
respect, Karnataka has moved steadily towards
ensuring greater autonomy for PRIs. Hopefully
this will promote more participatory governance
and better HD outcomes over the next decade.

Literacy and Education

CHAPTER 5

Literacy and Education
Introduction
Education is recognised as a fundamental human
right, along with other necessities, such as food,
shelter and water in The Universal Declaration on
Human Rights (1948). The advantages it confers
on individuals and nations are multi-dimensional
and multi-faceted. It sustains economic growth
by providing basic as well as specialised skills
that ensure increased productivity and higher
per capita incomes. Human development is
predicated upon universal access to education,
with its implications for equity and social justice.
Education empowers people to make informed
choices about their lives and about their rights
as citizens in a democracy. Gender justice gets
a boost when women have access to education,
which, by enhancing women’s knowledge and
employment capacity, increases their sense of
autonomy and self worth. People’s health status
improves as their education levels rise. Above all,
education is valued, quite simply, for itself and
the avenues of knowledge and awareness that
it opens for us.
Achievements in education in Karnataka have
been quite remarkable, and the state is moving
towards universal literacy at a steady pace. The
literacy rate increased from 56.04 per cent in
1991 to 66.64 per cent in 2001, with the female
literacy rate increasing more swiftly than the
male literacy rate. Overall, the gender disparity
in literacy is declining rather perceptibly and
the decline is much more evident in the less
economically developed districts of the state.
Karnataka has 51,904 primary schools (2003-04)
and the number of habitations with primary schools
within a distance of one kilometre increased from
84 per cent in 1993 to 88 per cent in 2002.
Enrolment in primary education grew at the rate of
one per cent for boys and two per cent for girls per
annum from 1990-91 to 2003-04. The dropout
rate for Classes I to IV came down from a high 31
per cent in 1993-94 to six per cent in 2001-02, but
increased thereafter, to 11 per cent in 2003-04.
For classes I to VIII, the dropout rate declined

from 54-59 per cent between 1992 and 2000
to 45.4 per cent in 2003-04. Karnataka has
taken steps to recruit women teachers, whose
numbers went up to 54 per cent in 2003-04.
At present there exists an extensive high school
network in the state and the midday meal scheme
covers nearly 66 lakh children in classes I to VII, in
both government and aided schools. As many as
1,088 high schools have computer-aided learning
centres, thereby bringing information technology
within the reach of rural students.
The constraints and challenges will have to be
confronted head-on. Overall, the mean years
of schooling have improved only marginally
over a four-year period, from 1999-2000 to
2003-04. The high levels of regional, caste and
gender disparities imply that not all the children
in the state have equal access to education.
The dropout rate in south Karnataka districts
in 2003-04 was lower than the state average
as well as north Karnataka’s average for boys
and girls. In terms of infrastructure in primary
schools, Hyderabad Karnataka performs poorly
while south Karnataka has better infrastructure
than other regions. More than 3 per cent schools

As noted in chapter 3, from 1990-91 to 2002-03,
the largest allocation of public education
expenditure went to general education, and
primary and secondary education within
general education, a pattern which reflects the
government’s priorities. Despite this, the share
of primary and secondary education in the

been more or less static. The combined public

13.3 per cent for over 12 years. While the state

and secondary education in terms of resources,
the overwhelmingly large share of revenue
expenditure in total expenditure indicates that,
in Karnataka, as in other southern states, not
enough investment is being directed towards
capital expenditure. The non-salary component is
low and the expenditure on school infrastructure,
curriculum development, instructional material,
in-service teachers’ training – in short, all the
elements that contribute to improving the quality
of education – is inadequate.

Literacy
Literacy’s positive association with improved
socio-economic development indicators, as well
as some demographic indicators, underlines its
crucial role in the process of human development.
Attainment of literacy improves people’s
productivity by strengthening their knowledge
and skill base, and this, in turn, increases their
income. The coefficient of correlation between
the population below the poverty line and the
female literacy rate in rural areas is –0.62,
indicating clearly that poverty and female
illiteracy are very closely linked (Table 5.1).
There is also likely to be greater improvement
in women’s status when their literacy levels
rise: for instance, there is a positive correlation
(0.28) between female literacy and the sex ratio
(Table 5.1). This is apparent from the situation
prevailing in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi
districts, which have the highest sex ratio in the
state, as well as a very high female literacy rate.
Karnataka’s literacy rate (66.64) has increased by
10 percentage points between 1991 and 2001.
Its literacy rate has been consistently higher than
all-India in all census years and is even higher than
the literacy rate in some neighbouring countries
such as Pakistan (44.0), Bangladesh (40.10)
and Nepal (39.20), but lower than Sri Lanka
(91.10). Karnataka, however, still has to catch
up with its neighbours, Kerala (90.9),Tamil Nadu
(73.5) and Maharashtra (76.9). The scenario in
Karnataka is somewhat mixed. About one-third
of the state’s population is still illiterate; the
illiteracy rate is more than 63 per cent and 58
per cent respectively among Scheduled Tribe
and Scheduled Caste females. As many as 15

districts (9 in north Karnataka and 6 in south
Karnataka) have a literacy rate that is below the
state average and 11 districts are even below
the national average, ranging from Raichur with
48.8 per cent to Mysore with 63.48 per cent.
One encouraging feature is that the female
literacy rate increased more rapidly (around
28 per cent) from 1991 to 2001 than the male
literacy rate (around 14 per cent). The gender
disparity in literacy has declined steadily over
the years, from 0.47 in 1961 to 0.19 in 2001,
indicating significant progress in the reduction
of female illiteracy. Another trend, which is
reflective of the success of policy interventions,
is the sharp decline in gender disparity in the
rural areas of even the relatively less developed
region of Hyderabad Karnataka. While the
literacy-gender disparity is higher in rural areas

Literacy rates in the various districts of the state
have improved significantly in 2001. The coastal
districts of Dakshina Kannada (83.35) and Udupi
(81.25) along with Bangalore Urban district
(82.96) continued to maintain their lead status as
high performers, well on the way to catching up
with Kerala, while four districts of the Hyderabad
Karnataka region were below the all-India
literacy rate in respect of total, male and female
literacy levels in both census years (1991 and
2001). The malnad districts of Kodagu (77.99),
Shimoga (74.52) and Chikmaglur (72.20)
maintained a steady growth in the literacy rate.
Within Hyderabad Karnataka, Bidar, despite
being below the state average, emerged as the
best performing district (60.94), while Raichur
occupied the lowest position in both census years.
Bijapur’s literacy rate was higher than the all-India
literacy rate in 1991, but regressed below the
all-India male, female and total literacy levels
in 2001. Other districts, which showed similar
deterioration and fell below the national literacy
rate, are Chitradurga (male and total literacy),
Bagalkot (male), Gadag (female) and Belgaum
(total literacy). It is possible that this somewhat
grim scenario is the outcome of the bifurcation
of certain districts (viz. Chitradurga, Bijapur
and Dharwad) in 1997, whereby pre-existing
intra-district differentials in literacy became
sharply outlined. The less developed Hyderabad
Karnataka districts gave cause to rejoice, having
registered the most marked improvements in
literacy in the state with the highest increases in
decennial growth: Raichur (3.58), Koppal (3.53)
and Bidar (3.05), while the lowest was Bijapur
with 0.13. Even Chamarajnagar, one of the most
underdeveloped districts in south Karnataka,
managed to improve its performance from 38.19
per cent in 1991 to 50.87 per cent in 2001.
The low female literacy rate in Karnataka, as in
India, is a visible manifestation of gender bias,
which refuses to acknowledge women’s inherent
right to education. Caste, class and geographical
factors are other sources of inequity that shape

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

female literacy levels. This becomes evident when
the inter-district performance in female literacy is
analysed. The highest female literacy rates are to
be found in Bangalore Urban (77.48), Dakshina
Kannada (77.21), and Udupi (75.19) districts,
and the lowest in Raichur (35.93), Gulbarga
(37.90) and Koppal (39.61). Geographically,
Gulbarga, Raichur and Koppal are contiguous and
share the same socio-economic characteristics
of underdevelopment, while Dakshina Kannada
and Udupi (which were originally one district)
have traditionally maintained good human
development indicators. The female literacy rate
in Bangalore Rural was a low 54.99 per cent –
lower than the state average, and lower than some
southern districts such as Davangere (58.04) or
Tumkur (56.94), which do not have the advantage
of lying in the immediate periphery of India’s
fastest growing city. Figure 5.1 shows the rural
female literacy rate between different districts of
the state and reveals wide variations between
north and south Karnataka. The mean literacy
rate of the districts of north Karnataka2 (60.99
per cent) is less than that of south Karnataka3
(69.52 per cent). There has been a sharp decline

in the variation (as reflected through coefficient of
variation) during the decade among districts, both
in the south (17.17 per cent in 1991 and 13.18
per cent in 2001) and the north (20.94 per cent in
1991 and 13.97 per cent in 2001). The variation
in literacy over the decade has been narrowing for
all caste groups. In Hyderabad Karnataka, female
literacy rates in rural areas reveal significant
improvements (the maximum in the state) in all
the districts during this period, showing that the
initiatives taken in the state have started bearing
fruit in recent years.
The literacy rate of rural females in Karnataka
is lower than that of urban females, as the
urban female literacy rate grew at a faster rate
than the rural female literacy rate. Raichur and
Koppal have the lowest urban female literacy
rates in Karnataka. As many as 10 districts in
north Karnataka and four districts of south
Karnataka have a rural female literacy rate that
is below the state average. The poor performing
districts in Bombay Karnataka are Bijapur and
Bagalkot while Raichur and Gulbarga are the
low performers in Hyderabad Karnataka and

In Hyderabad Karnataka,
female literacy rates
in rural areas reveal
significant improvements.

Chamarajnagar in south Karnataka (Appendix
Tables: Series 4).

The lowest gender
disparity in literacy is in
Bangalore Urban and the
highest in Raichur.

The gender disparity index has been calculated
by using Sophers’ disparity index where a high
index means high gender disparity. A noticeable
and welcome element is the fact that the gender
disparity in literacy has declined sharply over
the decade. The lowest gender disparity is in
Bangalore Urban and the highest disparity is
in Raichur. While gender disparity in literacy is
higher in north Karnataka than in south Karnataka,
it would be simplistic to say gender disparities are
insignificant in the southern districts. The female
literacy rate in Bangalore Rural district may have
improved over the decade, but it is still too low for
a district that has the advantage of being adjacent
to an urban centre.The intensity of difference may
be less in the southern districts, but the disparity
does exist and has serious effects on female
health and poverty. While it is reassuring to note
that, overall, the gender disparity in literacy is
declining and that the decline is faster in the more
underdeveloped regions, more policy interventions
are required if Karnataka is to meet the MDG
(Figure 5.2).
Since the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
populations are characterised by low literacy
rates, districts with high SC and ST populations
tend to have lower literacy rates than others (see
chapters 9 and 10).

State interventions
One reason for the existence of such high levels
of illiteracy in India, even today, when it is poised
to become a super power in this millennium, is
the low priority accorded to both adult literacy
and primary education in the post-Independence
years. The institutions of higher learning
established in those years have contributed
immeasurably to the country’s emergence as a
leader in the current knowledge-based global
economy, but the lack of policy seriousness in
tackling illiteracy as a grassroots movement
meant that increases in literacy levels took place
incrementally. The National Adult Education
Programme (NAEP), launched in 1978, was a
national programme to remove illiteracy, under
which funds were made available to states to
set up departments of adult education. The next
initiative, the National Literacy Mission 1988,
was launched in the then popular mission mode.
The Literacy Mission used a community based
approach to address adult illiteracy, drawing upon
volunteers and NGOs and using catchy tactics
such as jathas and street theatre to mobilise
people. In some states, the Literacy Mission met
with unexpected success in mobilising women
around social issues, as in the anti-arrack
agitation in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh. This kind
of social activism on this scale can be described
as true education (through empowerment) in
the broadest sense of the term. However, the
outcomes of the efforts of the NLM, when viewed

In Karnataka, Bijapur and Dakshina Kannada
were the first two districts to be selected for
implementation of the NLM. Their relative
performances are given in Table 5.5. It is now
recognised that the NLM could neither eradicate
illiteracy, as promised, nor make a spectacular
impact in Bijapur.
Having completed theTotal Literacy Campaign and
Post Literacy Campaign in all districts, continuing
education programmes are now being run in 18
districts. At the village level, there are Continuing
Education Centres (CEC) and Nodal Continuing
Education Centres (NCEC) at the taluk level.
Currently there are 1,513 NCECs and 14,145
CECs in the state. This lull in financing adult
literacy programmes by the Centre needs serious
rethinking when 33 per cent of the population is
still illiterate.

TABLE 5.5

Decennial growth in literacy: Bijapur and Dakshina
Kannada districts - 1991 and 2001
(Per cent)

Looking ahead, it may be noted that in 2001, the
literacy rate in urban and rural Karnataka was
80.58 and 59.33 per cent respectively, hence
the Tenth Plan goal of 75 per cent literacy rate
has already been met, in the urban areas at least,
although it will take some time for the rural areas
to catch up.The rate of increase in the literacy rate
in the rural areas between 1991 and 2001 was
about 12 percentage points and at this rate, ceteris
paribus, Karnataka is unlikely to meet the Tenth
Plan goal of literacy in the rural areas. Furthermore,
the goal of reducing the gender gap in literacy
by 50 per cent by 2007 can be achieved only
through strong policy initiatives. Between 1991
and 2001, the gender gap in literacy reduced by
only 3.1 and 3.76 percentage points in the rural
and urban areas of Karnataka respectively. Hence,
adult education needs another boost if the MDG
and Tenth Plan goals are to be fulfilled. A change
in strategy, which addresses the issue bottom–up,
i.e. from the gram panchayat up, is critical to the
success of adult literacy programmes.

Tertiary education is a vast sphere, encompassing
as it does, diverse fields such as professional
courses as well as general education. A plethora
of issues has emerged in higher education such as
financing, autonomy, governance, and quality – all
in the context of equity and social justice. It would
be difficult to address all these complex issues
within the confines of this chapter. The Task Force
on Higher Education (2004) has dealt with these
aspects of higher education very comprehensively.

With an urban literacy
rate of 80.58 per cent,
Karnataka has achieved
the Tenth Plan goal of
75 per cent literacy rate
in the urban areas
at least.

Primary education
The Supreme Court ruling in 1994 that a child has
a fundamental right to free education up to age
14 clearly directs the state government to take
responsibility for universal elementary education
(UEE). The state of Karnataka has made major

strides towards achieving the goal of UEE, which
requires the fulfilment of the following objectives:
(i) universal access to primary schools for all
children; (ii) universal enrolment; (iii) universal
retention; and (iv) universal achievement of
minimum essential levels of learning by all
children.

Access and enrolment
Karnataka has 51,904 primary schools (classes
I to VIII) in 2003-04, of which 43,447 are
government schools. Districts with the largest
number of primary schools are Kolar (3,940),
Tumkur (3,878), Belgaum (3,465) and Bangalore
Urban (3,242). However, the number of primary
schools by habitation is a better indicator of access
than mere numbers of schools. The number of
habitations with primary schools within a distance
of one kilometre increased from 84 per cent in
1993 to 88 per cent in 2002 (Seventh All-India
Education Survey: 2002). South Karnataka
schools generally serve smaller populations per
habitation (509) than north Karnataka schools
(1,024), with the exception of Uttara Kannada,
according to the Sixth All-India Education Survey.
In certain districts viz. Shimoga, Chikmaglur,
Hassan and Uttara Kannada, less than 75 per cent
of the habitations have a primary school within
a distance of one kilometre. These districts are
situated in the Western Ghats, where habitations
are small and widely dispersed. In most of the north
Karnataka districts, however, 90 to 99 per cent of
the habitations have a primary school within a
distance of one kilometre, due in part to the fact
that habitations are large and concentrated, but
also as an outcome of policies and projects in this
region (Table 5.6).
The government is the dominant provider of
primary education in Karnataka. The role of the
private sector is minimal, but it has registered
some growth in recent times. In 1990-91, about
89 per cent of all primary schools were government
schools, five per cent were private schools, which
received grants from the government, and six
per cent were unaided schools. By 2003-04,
aided schools and unaided schools constituted
4.83 per cent and 11.46 per cent respectively and
government schools constituted 83.71 per cent of

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

the total number of schools, indicating a modest
increase in the number of unaided schools and a
relative decline in the proportion of government
schools over a period of 13 years. The number of
private unaided schools in the state increased at a
compound growth rate of eight per cent per annum
during the period 1990-91 to 2003-04 while
aided schools and government schools increased
at 1.8 and 1.5 per cent respectively during the
same period. This suggests that there is now a
slight increase in the demand for unsubsidised,
primary schools but overall, the government’s
role as provider of education to the poor and
the vulnerable has not diminished significantly.
The absolute number of government schools has
increased, hence the government’s proactive role
continues. Districts with the highest percentage
of government primary schools (classes I to VIII)
are Udupi (95.05), Chikmaglur (91.63), Haveri
(91.59) and Bangalore Rural (91.00) (Appendix
Tables : Series 4) Table 5.7 reinforces this position:
the demand for private schooling is urban-driven
with a high concentration (34.1 per cent) of
private, unaided schools in urban areas where the
distribution of government schools is low at 47.4
per cent. Predictably, Bangalore Urban district
has the highest percentage (38.74) of private
unaided schools. Providers of private schooling
do not find it profitable to establish institutions in
rural areas where the population is predominantly
low-income and where habitations can be
both small and dispersed. The responsibility of
educating the poor is shouldered by the state
and any fallback here would have adverse
consequences for the attainment of UEE.

BOX 5.5

Enrolment in primary education (classes I to VII)
grew at the rate of 1.4 per cent, encompassing
growth of one per cent for boys and two per cent
for girls per annum, from 1990-91 to 2003-04,
indicating that girls’ education has received
an impetus. Girls’ enrolment grew from 36
per cent of the total enrolment in 1980-81
to 48 per cent in 2003-04. Bijapur, which
had the lowest rank among all the districts
in girls’ enrolment in 1997-98 (KHDR 1999),
continues to be the lowest ranked district in
2003-04, although enrolment increased from
42.2 per cent in 1997-98 to 46.8 per cent in

Learning via satellite
The Edusat Primary Education Project is a pilot project in distance education in primary education
and the first of its kind in the country. It is being implemented in collaboration with ISRO.
The infrastructure consists of a central hub at Bangalore and Receive only Terminals (ROTs)
with 29 sets in 885 schools in the educationally backward district of Chamarajnagar. Education
programmes uplinked from the hub are received via the Edusat satellite in all schools
simultaneously.
Edusat’s objectives are:

To bring in quality improvement in classroom transactions at the primary level;

To make learning child centred, interesting and motivating;

To supplement classroom teaching with audio-visual support;

To take children through real life situations;

To give students access to the best teachers in every field;

To ensure that ‘difficult’ topics in every subject are easily understood by children;

To provide inputs in non-curricular areas for the overall development of children;

To encourage teachers to develop teaching learning materials (TLM) and use them
effectively in classrooms.

Involving parents and the community
In 2001, School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs) replaced the Village
Education Committees (VECs) in Karnataka. An SDMC has a 3-year term. SDMCs comprise
nine elected parent members, four ex-officio members and six nominated members (including
students) to ensure parental and community involvement and participation in the day to day
activities of schools. A committee meets once a month to review the functioning of the school.

A study found:



85 per cent of the parents rated the functioning of SDMCs as good;
83 per cent of the parents attend meetings every month;
30 per cent of the teachers said that SDMCs have been effective in carrying out
improvements to schools through collective participation;
According to 28 per cent of the parents, the SDMC has a positive impact on retention,
attendance and enrolment;
Around 30 per cent of the parents said that SDMCs have improved the functioning of the
midday meal scheme;
79 per cent of the students reported that SDMC members visit schools regularly;
87 per cent of the students reported that SDMC members visit classes, verify whether
teachers conduct classes and randomly test some of the learning competencies; and
More than 70 per cent of the presidents of committees said that they have attempted to
bring out-of-school children back to school.

Contributed by SDMCs (2002-03):




38 per cent have contributed towards land and buildings;
26 per cent have provided teaching learning materials (TLMs); and
19 per cent have contributed cash.

Every day one family supplies the vegetables and coconuts required for the midday meal served
at the Government Lower Primary School, Jumbebeta, 40 km from Honnavara. The community
has constructed a separate dining room. In fact, the community itself started the school, which
the government later took over. The school is situated amid the thick forests of Uttara Kannada
district. Despite the distance factor and geographical location the community has ensured that
the school has furniture like benches, chairs, cupboards, etc. It cleans the playground through

shramadana.

Then and now...what a change!
Old timers say this higher primary school at Sivarampet in Mysore looked like a cowshed.
However, today it has been transformed by the local committee. This SDMC has formed
sub-committees to look after the various developmental activities of the school. It has provided a
range of facilities like drinking water, toilets, classrooms, power, a garden, teaching and learning
material, sports equipment, gymnasium, a computer and books.

Child and the National Law School of India University.

2003-04. There is not much variation between
districts in girls’ enrolment. Mandya has the
highest enrolment of ST girls and Gulbarga the
lowest enrolment for SC girls. Enrolment was the
highest in Bangalore Urban and the lowest in
Bellary, though it may be noted that there is not
much difference between the highest and lowest
enrolment numbers.
Gross and net enrolment ratios capture the
multiple dimensions of schooling. It is useful
to distinguish between the concept of gross
enrolment and net enrolment rate. Generally, the
gross and net enrolment ratios are used to capture
child schooling. The enrolment rate is defined as
the number of children enrolled in school divided
by the child population in the relevant age group.
The gross enrolment rate (GER) includes children
at a given educational level who may be over or
under-aged relative to the age group used as a
divisor. The net enrolment rate (NER) is obtained
by dividing the number of children in the relevant
age group enrolled in a particular stage by the
total child population in that specified age group.
The GER may, therefore, exceed 100 per cent.
The GER of the state increased from 92 in 1996-97
to 99 in 2000-01 and fell to 94.14 in 2003-04. In
1998-99, Raichur had the lowest GER and Udupi
the highest. In 2000-01, there was no change
in the status of Raichur where the GER (74.54)
was still the lowest, while Bangalore Urban
(128.21) was the highest. During 2003-04,
Dakshina Kannada had the highest GER and
Raichur still had the lowest GER. Bidar’s GER has
improved markedly particularly the GER of girls,

which is now on a par with their male counterparts.
Across castes, the GER of the Scheduled Tribes
(STs) is lower than that of the general population
and the Scheduled Castes (SCs). In fact, there has
been a great improvement in the GER of the SCs,
which has overtaken the general population in
2000-01, and which is a direct outcome of the
government’s special incentive schemes. Some
introspection and remedial action is called for
with regard to the STs, who have a different set of
problems altogether.
Table 5.8 reveals that all north Karnataka districts
have very high net enrolment ratios. In 2004-05,
Bidar for example, has an NER of 130 for classes
I to V and 131 for classes VI to VII, the highest in
the state.
The high GER and NER figures indicate that
the first two objectives – universal access and
enrolment – have largely been achieved, and
increased attention is now required in the areas of
retention/attendance and quality of learning.

The dropout rate is an indicator of the efficiency
of the primary school system since it presents an
overview of the wastage of human resources.
Non-attendance and/or dropping-out are the
outcomes of a combination of factors at the
individual, institutional and structural levels.
Structurally, poverty means that parents cannot
afford the opportunity costs, preferring to put
their children to work, either at home or for other
people. For girls, gender disparity combines with
poverty to keep them out of school for a variety of
reasons, ranging from early marriage to using girls
for housework and sibling care. Lack of parental
support, caused largely by the parents’ own low
education levels and lack of motivation, is another
strong inhibiting factor. If schools are far from the
habitation or have inadequate infrastructure with
reference to classrooms, toilets for girls and drinking
water, then parents feel discouraged.Within schools,
multi-grade teaching, poor instructional quality,
teacher absenteeism, repetition and the lack of

The high GER and NER
figures indicate that the
objectives of universal
access and enrolment have
largely been achieved.

TABLE 5.8

Net enrolment ratio
Retention
The mean years of schooling are used as an
indicator of levels of educational attainment.
Overall, the mean years of schooling have
improved only marginally over a four year period,
from 3.97 in 1999-2000 to 4.25 in 2003-04, and
there is little difference between boys and girls.
Across social groups the mean years of schooling
of Scheduled Tribe students is slightly lower than
the Scheduled Castes as well as the non-SC and
non-ST students.
Boys out-perform girls among the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes, but overall, there is no significant
difference in the mean years of schooling for girls
and boys in the non-SC and non-ST group. Ten
districts (all 5 districts of Hyderabad Karnataka;
Chamarajnagar, Davangere, Bijapur, Bagalkot,
and Belgaum) are below the state average for
mean years of schooling for girls in 2003-04. If
free education up to the age of 14, as mandated
in the Constitution, is taken as the norm, then all
children must have eight mean years of schooling,
and current achievement levels, therefore, fall well
short of this objective.

Mahiti Sindhu: IT at the grassroots
This year, the Government High School in the Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bangalore
was adjudged the best secondary school providing computer education in the state and was
honoured by the President of India.
This success story has been replicated in 1,000 government secondary schools across the state
where computer learning has become a way of life for nearly 4,00,000 children over the past
4 years.
Quarterly evaluations of the programme are being regularly conducted by the Computer Science
departments of local engineering colleges under the guidance of the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore. Teachers in these schools are trained in computer application, thereby enhancing
their teaching skills.

correlation between education and market-based
job skills are some factors that encourage dropouts.
This combination of factors means that 45 out of
100 children enrolled in class I are likely to drop
out by class VIII.
The dropout rate increases as students move up
from class I: 2003-04 figures show that out of
100 children who enrolled in class I, 11 per cent
dropped out by the end of class IV, 29 per cent
dropped out by the end of class VII and 45 per cent
by the end of class VIII. The survival rate of
children in the higher classes declines even
more sharply. The dropout rate for classes I to
IV ranged from a high 31 per cent in 1993-94
to 6 per cent in 2001-02; for classes I to VII,
it fluctuated between 52.8 per cent (1993-94)
to 29 per cent (2003-04); for classes I to VIII,
the dropout rate has been fairly high from
1992-93 to 1999-2000 (59 to 54 per cent),
before it dropped to 45.4 per cent in 2003-04
(Figure 5.5).
Poverty has been identified as one of the main
reasons for high dropout rates since the poor
cannot afford the opportunity costs of education.
However, there are other facets of this issue. The
dropout rate for girls is invariably higher than
that of boys in all classes. While there has been a
decline in the dropout rate over the years, for both
boys and girls, the decline is more perceptible for
boys, who are regarded as socio-economic assets
by the family and investing in their education is
perceived as producing favourable outcomes by
way of enhanced vocational skills and higher wages.
Investing in girls’ education is not high priority,
partly because it does not benefit the birth family
directly, but mainly because women are treated as
marginal beings who can be pulled out of school
to manage the home and assist in sibling care.
Figure 5.6 indicates the dropout rate for both boys
and girls. The dropout rate for the state is further
shaped by regional disparities. The dropout rate
in the districts of south Karnataka in 2003-04 is
lower than both the state average and the average
for north Karnataka, for boys, girls and all children.
Even in north Karnataka itself, there are gaps
between the Hyderabad Karnataka and Bombay
Karnataka regions.The dropout rate in the districts

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

of Hyderabad Karnataka, which was 56.5 per cent
(1999-2000) and 46.7 per cent (2003-04),
was markedly higher than 36.8 per cent
(1999-2000) and 29.7 per cent (2003-04) in
the districts of the Bombay Karnataka region. The
gender gap in the dropout rate is very high in the
northern districts whereas it has been steadily
dwindling in the southern districts. The sharp
decline in the dropout rate can be attributed to the
concerted efforts of the state to enroll all eligible
children, retain them in school and to bring back
out-of-school children into either the formal or a
non-formal system. Many of these schemes target
the educationally backward districts of the state.

Initiatives for north Karnataka
On the basis of the recommendations of the
Report for the Redressal of Regional Imbalances
(2002), certain actions have been initiated to
improve education indicators in the northern
districts of the state:
 Separate
Additional Commissionerates
of Public Instruction were established at
Belgaum and Gulbarga in 2003-04;
 Separate Regional Secondary Examination
Boards were established at Belgaum and
Gulbarga.
 The cooked midday meals programme was
initially launched in 9,724 government
primary schools in the northern districts of
Karnataka during 2001-02;
 50 per cent of the non-salary grants of the
state education budget under primary and
secondary heads have been earmarked for north Karnataka from 2001-02 onwards;
 2,587 posts of primary school teachers were moved from other parts of the state during
2001-02 and 2002-03 to this region to improve the pupil–teacher ratio.
 The pupil-teacher ratio in north Karnataka districts came down from 42.04 in the year
2001-02 to 40.97 in the year 2003-04;
 Large education districts were bifurcated to improve efficiency.

According to the Children’s Census conducted by
the Department of Public Instruction in 2005, the
highest percentage of out-of-school children in the
age group 7-14 is among STs and SCs. These two
social classes also have the highest percentage of
out-of-school girls.
The state has a gamut of schemes directed at
ensuring universal enrolment and retention. Under
the Vidya Vikasa programme, school children in
classes I to VII get free text books and uniforms.
Akshara Dasoha, the midday meals scheme, was
initially introduced in seven northern districts and
was subsequently extended to cover all children
in classes I to VII in both government-and privateaided schools.This helps over 60 lakh children and
the expenditure is of the order of Rs.280 crore.
For girls, there are attendance scholarships.
Karnataka has pioneered various schemes for
bringing out-of-school children back to school.
The schemes directly address all the major
constraints faced by out-of-school children and
their families. They are Chinnara Angala (bringing
out-of-school children back to school), Coolienda
Shalege (for child labour), flexi schools (night
schools for working children), mobile schools (for
slum children), Beediyinda Shalege (for street
children), Baa Baale Shalege (for the girl child),
Kishori Kendra (residential bridge courses for girls
in Bellary and Koppal), and Samudayadatta Shale
(community rallies). These schemes have enabled
the state to mainstream a number of out-ofschool children into primary education. Chinnara

How to guarantee learning
The Learning Guarantee Programme is co-managed by the Government of Karnataka and the
Azim Premji Foundation with the goal of creating willingness among schools and communities
to come forward and be evaluated on the criteria of enrolment, attendance and learning
achievements of children. Schools that satisfy the criteria are eligible for awards.The programme
aims to inspire and motivate teachers and schools to develop classroom practices and processes
that enable every child to learn.
The programme was launched in 8 education districts of north Karnataka – Bellary, Bijapur,
Bagalkot, Raichur, Bidar, Gulbarga, Yadgir and Koppal. Participation in the programme was
voluntary and open to all primary and upper primary schools that chose to participate. As many as
6,484 schools sent in applications expressing an interest to participate in the programme and 896
schools volunteered for assessment in 2003 with the number increasing to 1,443 in 2004.



1,888 schools (20 per cent of the government schools) are participating in the
programme;
Over 2,00,000 children were tested;
82 schools won the Learning Guarantee Programme Award for 2004;
The average pupil–teacher ratio (PTR) in the winning schools is 28.5 against the north
Karnataka average of 43;
11 per cent of the lower primary schools (LPS) evaluated were winners vs. 3 per cent
higher primary schools;
While 24 schools that won in 2003 did not win again in 2004, 16 schools repeated their
success and 48 schools that did not win in 2003 came out winners in 2004, showing that
schools can improve but must also guard their excellence zealously.

The Lower Primary School at Hanakanahalli, a small village in Bellary district, stands out as
a good example of what dedicated teachers, a supportive SDMC and enlightened parents can
achieve if they work together as a team. The school, which was graded ‘B’ last year, upped its
ante this year and emerged as an ‘A’ grade school. It is also the only school where all its
students demonstrated 100 per cent achievement in Kannada and Mathematics. Yet,
this multi-grade school has just two teachers who manage 33 students studying in five classes
in two rooms, one of which also serves as the office.

Angala has succeeded in mainstreaming more
than half of the total beneficiary children. The
highest proportion of children mainstreamed for
all schemes is in the Hyderabad Karnataka region.
However, even programmes with a small number
of beneficiaries are no less critical since the real
effort lies in enrolling the ‘last mile’ children.
These children are from the most disadvantaged
sections of society – urban street children and
child labourers – whose income is critical to their
families, and getting them into school is a difficult
task (Table 5.11).

Infrastructure
Lack of infrastructure or inadequate infrastructure
is among the factors cited for high dropout rates.
Causes range from lack of classrooms, latrines,
and separate latrines for girls, to not provisioning
safe drinking water. An infrastructure index has
been constructed based on the percentage of
schools run in their own buildings, availability
of electricity, water, common toilets, separate
toilets for girls, pucca buildings/kutcha buildings/
no building. The infrastructure index has been
constructed by using the formula: average of
[(Actual - Min)/(Max - Min)]. Based on this index,
Bangalore Urban district (0.81) tops in terms of
facilities provided to students and Uttar Kannada
(0.20) is last. The extent of the gulf between

Teachers
Ensuring that there is an adequate number of
trained teachers obviously improves the quality of
instruction in schools. In Karnataka, only trained
teachers are recruited, and the department is
conducting in-service training regularly. There has
been a perceptible improvement in the pupil–
teacher ratio (PTR) at the primary level, which
declined from 38 in 1998-99 to 35 in 2003-04,
indicating that Karnataka has now attained the
national norm of 35 students per teacher at the
primary level. Across districts, however, no district
in north Karnataka, except Uttara Kannada, and all
the districts of south Karnataka except Bangalore
Urban and Dakshina Kannada have fulfilled this
norm (Appendix Tables: Series 4). This is probably
because habitations in most of south Karnataka,
as in Uttar Kannada district, are small and widely
dispersed. Within Hyderabad Karnataka, Bidar
has the lowest PTR. Urban schools have a higher
PTR than rural schools, due, in part, to the lower
student strength in rural schools. Managementwise, the PTR for 2003-04 indicates that the
PTR is higher in private aided schools than in
government and unaided schools.The trend shows
that a high PTR is correlated with low enrolment
and a high dropout rate. The Learning Guarantee
Scheme found that the high-performing schools
in north Karnataka had a PTR (28.5) which was
markedly lower than the local average of 43.

Bangalore Urban and the second ranking district,
Kodagu, is represented by 0.16 points. Across
regions, Hyderabad Karnataka has the lowest and
south Karnataka the highest infrastructure index.
Within south Karnataka, Chitradurga, Tumkur
and Hassan have lower infrastructure indices
than certain districts of north Karnataka such as
Dharwad and Gadag (Figure 5.7). A study found
that poor school infrastructure not only repelled
students, it also kept teachers away as well (World
Bank 2004). Better infrastructure for teachers
meant availability of teachers’ toilets, electricity,
covered classrooms, non-mud floors and libraries.
In fact, it has been found that schools that are
near paved roads have less teacher absence.

More than 3 per cent of schools are still without
teachers and 19 per cent schools function

Girls’ education gets
a strong impetus with
the presence of female
teachers in a school.
Government policy
directs that women shall
constitute not less than
50 per cent of teachers
recruited to the state
school system. The
proportion of female
teachers has, accordingly,
increased from 46
per cent in 1998-99 to
54 per cent in 2003-04.

112

with single teachers (Seventh All-India School
Education Survey, Provisional Statistics, 2002).
This problem is more pronounced in rural areas,
while urban areas often have a glut of teachers.
This affects the quality of instruction and widens
the rural–urban and inter-district disparity in
teaching and learning.
Teacher absenteeism, whether for authorised or
unauthorised reasons, has an adverse effect on
the quality of education. A World Bank survey
(2004) found that nearly 22 per cent of teachers
are absent from government primary schools on a
typical day in Karnataka.
Teachers who are more powerful, defined in this
context, as male, older and better educated, and
head teachers, are more likely to be absent. In
this respect, the survey found that there was not
much difference between government and private
(aided and unaided) school teachers or regular
and contract employees. Multi-grade schools
report a higher incidence of teacher absence. Only
45 per cent of the teachers surveyed were actually
found teaching during the survey. Low teacher
attendance translates into low student attendance
and poor examination scores.

Girls’ education gets a strong impetus with
the presence of female teachers in a school.
Government policy directs that women shall
constitute not less than 50 per cent of teachers
recruited to the state school system. The proportion
of female teachers has, accordingly, increased
from 46 per cent in 1998-99 to 54 per cent in
2003-04. Kodagu has the highest proportion
of female teachers (79.2 per cent) and Bijapur
the lowest (38 per cent) in 2003-04. Dakshina
Kannada has seen a significant improvement in
this regard, from 39.26 per cent in 1998-99 to
73.91 per cent in 2003-04, but the percentage
of female teachers has declined in Bangalore
Urban, Koppal and Udupi districts. The proportion
of women teachers in rural schools is about half of
that in urban schools with a few exceptions. While
this says something about the lack of facilities for
women teachers in rural areas, it also has adverse
gender outcomes in terms of low girls’ enrolment
and retention in rural Karnataka.

Minimum levels of learning
Achievement of certain minimum levels of
learning is the fourth objective of UEE and the
most difficult to attain. Given the huge spread of
the public school system, maintaining uniformity
in instructional quality is a challenging task.
Certain programmes have been introduced by the
government to improve the quality of teaching
and learning. Keli-Kali is an innovative radio
programme for primary school children. The radio
programmes are broadcast across the state to
cover nearly 6.1 million students in classes III
to VI. Its objectives are to provide the benefit of
expert teaching to all students, promote student
teacher interaction and to inculcate in children
an awareness of joyful learning. Songs, local
dialects, folklore and sound effects contribute to
the attractiveness and topicality of the lessons.
With so many multi-grade schools still in
existence, managing uniform levels of learning
in all grades becomes a complex task for the
teacher. Bahumukhi, a training module on
multi-grade and multi-level learning, enables
teachers to implement strategies such as
effective implementation of instructional plan,
activity-based teaching methodology, effective

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

use of teaching and learning material (TLM) and
community resources, co-curricular activities,
classroom management, time management,
Keli-Kali radio lessons and continuous and
comprehensive evaluation, to ensure that students
in multi-grade schools do not lose out on quality.
More recently, the trimester system has been
introduced: (i) to ensure there is continuous and
activity-based learning during the academic
year, through project work; (ii) to render learning
more meaningful and interesting to children, by
including non-cognitive areas such as drawing,
music, yoga, drama and value education in the
curriculum; (iii) to build systems for internal
assessment and evaluation by introducing grades
for evaluation. All these are recent initiatives
directed at improving the quality of instruction and
learning and the real test is whether the system
can be successfully replicated across regions and
schools with varying levels of infrastructure.
Examination scores may not be the best way of
testing a child’s learning skills since the system
itself prioritises rote learning over comprehension
and analysis. At present, however, it is the only
formal system of evaluation of student and teacher
performance and one way of assessing the quality
of instruction is to look at the number of children
who appear for, and pass the examinations
after completing seven years of schooling. The
government has a policy of ‘no detention till
class V’, thereby ensuring that all children who
attend school for a minimum number of days are
promoted to the next higher class, irrespective
of learning achievements. While this policy helps
to keep children in school, thus increasing the
years of schooling and reducing dropouts, its
effect on levels of learning is not satisfactory. The
examination results indicate an improvement in
the pass percentage from 84 per cent in 1997 to
91 per cent in 2002. Despite their high dropout
rate, girls have a better pass percentage than boys.
This trend is manifested across all caste groups,
leading to the inevitable conclusion that the socioeconomic factors that work against retaining girls
in school cause a tremendous waste of human
potential for the individual and the country. Across
districts, Gulbarga had the lowest and Mandya

the highest pass percentage in 2002. There is
little significant difference in the pass percentages
of different caste groups. It is self-evident that
districts with high literacy rates, a low dropout
rate, low PTR and good infrastructure in schools
will perform well in the class VII examination.
Table 5.14 presents a summary of examination
results.

Secondary education
The demand for secondary education is bound
to increase as Karnataka moves steadily
towards universal elementary education. The
demand is likely to peak within a few years
of the inception of the Eleventh Plan period.
The educational sector will have to address the
challenges of universal secondary education by
ensuring budgetary support for putting in place
the infrastructure required to meet the needs of
the most underdeveloped districts of the state,
so that quality does not become a casualty as
the system expands its outreach. Universal
access is emerging as a critical concern since
denial of quality education to children because
of gender, economic class, caste and geographic
location raises serious equity issues. Retention
of students who enter secondary education calls
for imaginative approaches to ensuring that
instructional material and curricula are relevant
and develop vocational skills in students.

Access
In the year 2003-04, Karnataka had 9,012
high schools, representing a 10 per cent growth
since the last HDR (1999). Of these, 3,029 were
government, 2,621 were private aided and 3,362
were unaided institutions. Bangalore Urban
district (1,179) had the largest number of high
schools followed by Belgaum (636) and Tumkur
(593) (Appendix Tables: Series 4).

Given the dominance
of the private sector in
secondary education,
government schools
fortunately have a strong
presence in rural areas
where they can achieve
optimal impact in terms of
universal access.

Private, unaided schools grew very rapidly from
845 in 1990-91 to 3,362 in 2003-04. From
1998-99 to 2002-03, however, the rate of
growth of unaided schools was 20 per cent while
government and aided schools grew at 46 and
seven per cent respectively. About two-third of high
schools are located in south Karnataka whereas
only 57.3 per cent of the state’s population
resides in this region. This pattern is replicated
for all types of management. Gulbarga had the
highest number of government schools (251),
Belgaum the largest number of aided schools
(271) and Bangalore Urban had 841 unaided
schools. In fact, Bangalore Urban depends heavily
on the private sector to provide school education.
It also had a large number of private, aided
schools (235). Districts adjacent to Bangalore
Urban such as Tumkur, Kolar and Bangalore Rural,
and Belgaum and Bidar in north Karnataka also
had a significant number of unaided high schools.
In addition to Bangalore Urban district, Belgaum,
Bijapur, Bangalore Rural, Chitradurga, Dakshina
Kannada, Davangere,Tumkur and Uttara Kannada
had a heavy concentration of aided schools.

The distribution pattern of high schools does not
seem to be correlated with the socio-economic
needs of the student population. Given the
dominance of the private sector in secondary
education, government schools fortunately have
a strong presence in rural areas where they can
achieve optimal impact in terms of universal
access, while unaided schools are concentrated
in urban areas where incomes are higher and
parents are ready to pay for what is perceived
as ‘quality education’. ‘Quality’ is that highly
marketable commodity which is associated with
private schools, aided and unaided, though
unaided schools which do not have to conform
to certain government regulations are seen as
vastly superior by parents.The social awareness of
urban parents about the importance of education
in enhancing their wards’ life skills and enlarging
their choices leads them to demand quality in
education, and they are both willing and able to
pay for ‘quality’ education, which often means
education in English-medium schools.
The scenario is quite different among the poor,
who have to be persuaded into accepting the
value of education and be motivated to send
their children to school. The elite do not send their
wards to government schools because they lack
quality. Private schools typically provide better
infrastructure such as classrooms, laboratories,
libraries, and other resources such as sports
and extra-curricular activities, but at a price. In
terms of quality, government has highly qualified
teachers, but in terms of motivation and outcomes,
private schools often do better. This does result in
a scenario where the poor and marginal groups
have access to an education quite different from
that which the elite enjoy. The answer would be to
improve the quality of education in government
schools and hope that private schools will provide
scholarships to the academically gifted poor, as in
the West.

Enrolment
Enrolment in high schools increased from 5,57,735
in 1997-98 to 19,49,404 in 1999-2000 and was
19,51,313 in 2002-03. In the year 1997-98, the
percentage of girls was 43, which increased to
46.5 in 2003-04 (Table 5.16).

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

The gross enrolment ratio in secondary education
in classes I to X has improved from 84 in 1998-99
to 90 in 2000-01. There is a marked difference
between the GER of girls (87) and boys (93).
Across social groups, the GER of ST students is
lower than that of SCs and all communities.
A completely different picture emerges if one
examines the GER for classes XI and XII only. In
1998-99, the GER for the secondary stage was
47.9 and it increased to 52.1 in 2003-04. There
is not much difference between boys and girls.The
GER for these two classes is almost half of the
GER for classes I to X (Table 5.17). In 2000-01
and 2003-04, the GER of Raichur was the lowest
in respect of all children, girls and boys. Gulbarga
has the lowest GER for ST children in 2000-01.

Retention
There has been a decline in the dropout rate in
secondary education (classes I to X) over the
years. In 1992-93, the dropout rate in secondary

FIGURE 5.8

Percentage of Schools

South Karnataka may have the highest percentage
of enrolled girls, but enrolment has grown more
rapidly in the Bombay and Hyderabad Karnataka
regions. There has been a truly impressive growth
in ST girls’ enrolment in Hyderabad Karnataka.
Overall, the proportion of enrolment among girls
from the Scheduled Tribes is higher than that of
Scheduled Castes and over the years, the enrolment
of ST girls has increased at a faster rate than that
of others. Hassan had the highest percentage of
enrolled girls and Koppal the lowest in 2003-04.
However, the enrolment among the SC and ST girls
in some districts is still a matter of concern; for
example, it is below 25 per cent and 29 per cent
in Koppal and Gulbarga districts respectively.
Significant gender differentials in enrolment exist
between rural and urban areas in some of the less
developed districts of north Karnataka, viz. Bijapur,
Bagalkot, Gulbarga, Bellary and Raichur (Seventh
All-India Education Survey, 2002, Provisional
Statistics). Government schools have the highest
number of enrolled girls, indicating that they either
fulfill the demands of equity or that parents are
less willing to incur the costs of private schooling
for daughters. However, the retention rate of girls
declines in the higher classes as they are pulled out
of school to get married or to stay at home.

59.61 per cent in 2003-04. Kodagu had the
lowest dropout rate and Bellary the highest in
1999-2000. In 2003-04, Kodagu and Tumkur
had the lowest dropout rates, i.e. below 23

(76.55 per cent) and Bellary (75.77 per cent)
had the highest percentage of dropouts that year.
About 61 per cent girls drop out when they reach
class X. The dropout rate of girls varied from 16

Literacy and Education

per cent (Kodagu) to a high 79 per cent in
Gulbarga in 2003-04. The overall dropout rate
is high in north Karnataka as only three districts
of this region are below the state average as
compared to eight districts of south Karnataka,
which are below the state average. Figure 5.9
depicts that even though the dropout ratio has
been declining since 1992-93 to 2003-04, it is
still quite high at around 60 per cent.

Appointment of teachers
Recruitment of teachers has kept pace with
enrolment, as the pupil–teacher ratio has
remained almost constant: merely changing
from 23 in 1997-98 to 25 in 2002-03. Bidar
has the highest PTR and Kodagu the lowest, but
the variation between regions is not significant.
The presence of women teachers, especially in
rural areas, actively enhances the enrolment and
retention of girls at the secondary level. Parents
hesitate to send teenagers to schools that are
staffed almost exclusively by men.The percentage
of female teachers in the state was 33.37
per cent in 1998-99, but fell to 32.33 per cent
in 2002-03. Bijapur had the lowest percentage
of female teachers (13.2) and Bangalore Urban
the highest (64.5) in 1998-99. By 2003-04
Gulbarga had the lowest percentage (10.16)
while Bangalore Urban still topped the list with
58.68 per cent female teachers. This highlights
an unfortunate trend which is confirmed by the
Seventh All-India Education Survey provisional
figures: the percentage of women teachers in
rural areas is almost half the number in urban
areas in almost all districts. Districts in the

School infrastructure
This is another variable that influences both
enrolment and retention, especially of girl students.
Drinking water and separate toilets for girls are
not always available in high school buildings. Only
32 per cent of the high schools in the state have
separate toilets for girls and only 46 per cent
have common toilets for boys and girls. Gadag
has the highest percentage of high schools with
toilets for girls and Chamarajnagar the lowest.
The absence of toilets for adolescent girls is rather
high in the state. Uttara Kannada, Gulbarga and
Chamarajnagar have the lowest infrastructure
index while Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and
Chikmaglur have the highest (Figure 5.10).

Hyderabad Karnataka and Bombay Karnataka
region, with low retention numbers for girls, are
also below the state average in terms of women
teachers (Table 5.18). This scenario does little
to whittle away at socio-cultural biases that
work for the attrition of girls in secondary
education. The gender biases that women
teachers experience in the work place also
encourage them to opt for the relative security
of urban areas. This is one Catch 22 situation to
which innovative solutions, such as residential
quarters for women teachers and residential
schools for girls, will have to be found.

overall, girls in every social group usually outperform boys. As we saw, the enrolment of girls
is lower than that of boys and their dropout rate

continue with their education, then they perform
exceedingly well. Their high attrition rate from
class I to X signals wastage of human resources

Since the focus of this chapter is school education,
we propose to dwell only briefly on the next levels
of education. ‘Plus-two’, or ‘pre-university’ (PU)
education, in Karnataka is conducted in both high
schools and pre-university colleges. Conceptually, it
is a bridge leading from high school to professional
courses in medicine, engineering, agriculture et. al.
or to general education. A student who passes high
school should ideally decide at this point whether
he or she wants to pursue vocational education in
polytechnics, industrial training institutes or at the
plus-two stage itself in pre-university courses, or
move on to tertiary education.

The ratio of PU colleges increased from 3.9
per one lakh population in 1998 to 4.4 in
2003-04. Overall, PU colleges are unevenly
distributed across the state, with southern
Karnataka having the highest number of PU
colleges and Hyderabad Karnataka the least.
In 2003-04, eight districts in north Karnataka
and four districts in south Karnataka were
below the state average. The enrolment in PU
colleges has increased at a faster rate than for
all other institutions.

The performance of students in PU examinations
shows that there has been significant
improvement in pass percentages in the state,
from 48 per cent in 1997-98 to 58 per cent in
2003-04. Girls have done better than boys in all
districts. While this is heartening, it also leads to
some uncomfortable questions about attrition at
the next level, i.e. enrolment in tertiary education
where girls are under-represented. Across
districts, Dakshina Kannada tops the list while

A student can pick vocational courses from a
variety of institutions: polytechnics, industrial
training institutes (ITIs) and vocational courses
at the PU level itself. The objective here is to
reduce the pressure on higher education, but
more important, to impart vocational skills to
prepare students for self-employment. About
182 polytechnics (38 government, 36 aided and
108 private institutions) offer diploma courses
in various engineering disciplines, fashion
technology, commercial practice, cinematography,
etc. About 70,000 students are enrolled in these
courses. The department of Vocational Education
runs 890 courses as diverse and disparate as
dairying, accountancy, garment design, civil
construction and computer technology to name a
few. There were 68 government and 328 private
ITIs in the state in 1998-99, which increased to
104 and 466 by 2003-04, showing a growth rate
of 8.9 per cent and 7.3 per cent per annum for
government and private ITIs respectively.
The spread of government polytechnics varies
from a low 11 per cent in Bombay Karnataka to
a high 28 per cent each in southern Karnataka
and Hyderabad Karnataka. The southern districts
have the highest proportion of private unaided
institutions (61.67) in 2002-03. The dominance
of private institutions, particularly in the backward
areas of the state, is likely to create inequalities,
as only the higher income groups can afford
them. The predominance of the private sector is
again apparent when we look at the ITI stream
of vocational training. In 2003-04, Belgaum
district had the highest number of government
institutions and Koppal had the lowest number of
private ITIs, while south Karnataka has a better
distribution of institutions than north Karnataka.
The enrolment in ITIs increased at a compound

The enrolment in government institutions
increased at 10.8 per cent while in private
institutions it grew at 7.2 per cent per annum
during the same period. Girls constitute only 16.6
per cent of all students and the enrolment of girls
was about 2.5 times higher in south Karnataka
than in north Karnataka (2003-04). The lowest
proportion of girls’ enrolment was in Koppal
district (0.95) while Chitradurga (50.2) had the
highest. Disturbingly, girls’ enrolment in ITIs is
very low in the less developed districts.
Vocational education institutions, both government
and private, show a sharp decline over the period
1998-99 to 2003-04. The decline in private
institutions (3.63 per cent) is more marked than in
government institutions (0.68) but there has been

How relevant and useful are these courses and to
what extent do they succeed in providing viable
alternatives to tertiary education courses? The
Task Force on Higher Education (2004) reports
that annually, only 59 per cent of the intake in
polytechnics is utilised, showing severe wastage.
Ultimately, these courses will find takers only
if they lead to employment and enhanced
incomes.

An education index of districts (EI) has been
computed based on the literacy rate and the
GER. Despite significant improvement in the EI
of Raichur in 1991-2001, the relative status of
this district has not changed. In 1991, Raichur
district occupied the lowest position and
Dakshina Kannada ranked first among districts.
In 2001, Raichur occupied the lowest place for
all communities and Scheduled Castes, while
Gulbarga district is last in the EI for Scheduled
Tribes. Bangalore Urban, Kodagu, Dakshina
Kannada and Udupi are well above the state
average while Raichur, Gulbarga, Koppal, Bellary
and Chamarajnagar are below the state average
(Table 5.20).

There is a need to evaluate these courses and
ascertain how many students actually get the
jobs/vocations for which they study. Vocational
education is a complex area, since changes in
the job market/business scenario can impact
the courses that are being offered. Institutions
have to be dynamic and have the flexibility to
add new options/courses, e.g. repair of mobile
phones, computers and eliminate courses that
are no longer relevant to the market. Government
institutions too need to operate under a framework
that allows for such flexibility. Private institutions
may be slightly better placed in this respect, but
both government and private institutions have
the same boards, which dictate course content
and which are slow to respond to new market
demands.

In 2001, Karnataka’s urban literacy rate was
80.58 per cent, hence the Tenth Plan goal of
75 per cent literacy has already been met
in the urban areas at least, but the rural
areas with 59.33 per cent literacy are some
distance from the goal.
The goal of reducing the gender gap in
literacy by 50 per cent by 2007 seems
over-ambitious since, between 1991 and
2001, the gender gap in literacy dwindled
by only 3.1 and 3.76 percentage points
in the rural and urban areas respectively.
The illiteracy rate is more than 63 per cent
among Scheduled Tribes and about 58 per
cent among Scheduled Caste females.
The literacy level of SCs in Karnataka was
higher than the all-India SC literacy level
with reference to both female and total
literacy in 1991. In 2001, the SC literacy
rate was lower than the all-India SC male,
female and all, which is a matter of great
concern.
As many as 15 districts (9 in north and 6 in
south Karnataka) have a literacy rate that is
below the state average, while five districts of
the Hyderabad Karnataka region are below
the all-India literacy rate in respect of total,
male and female literacy levels.
North Karnataka, especially Hyderabad
Karnataka, performs poorly in several
indicators. Enrolment rates have risen in
primary education in the state particularly in
Raichur district, but unfortunately the GER of
this district has been the lowest in the state
from 1996-97 to 2000-01 meaning that
all districts are working towards improving
enrolment and retention and Raichur will
need special attention to match them. The
highest dropout rate for girls is in Gulbarga
(58 per cent) and Bellary (55.40 per cent) in
2003-04 in classes I to VII. Retention is thus
a crucial challenge.
The mean years of schooling have increased
only slightly from 3.97 in 1999-2000 to
4.25 in 2003-04.
Significant work remains to be done to
enhance the quality of teaching-learning.
The ‘no detention’ policy, while encouraging















retention of children upto class V, could also
lead to an inadequate assessment of learning
and teaching in the first four years (which are,
admittedly, the most significant years as far
as learning is concerned). Further, measures
to assess learning are still largely dominated
by test-of-memory examinations.
About three per cent primary schools in rural,
and four per cent schools in urban areas, do
not have any teachers at all while slightly more
than 20 per cent in rural and seven per cent
schools in urban areas have only one teacher.
Nine districts in north Karnataka and five
districts in south Karnataka have less than 50
per cent female teachers in primary schools
in 2003-04.
Primary school infrastructure is a critical
variable for retention. However, as many as
nine out of 12 districts of north Karnataka
are below the state infrastructure index
average. DPEP districts should have basic
infrastructure as it was one of the objectives
of DPEP, but it seems this has been only
partially fulfilled with 6 out of 11 (DPEP)
districts still below the state average. As many
as seven districts in southern Karnataka are
below the infrastructure index average.
The dropout rate at the secondary level is
about 60 per cent by the time students reach
class X.The low percentage of female teachers
and lack of infrastructure are contributory
factors to the high dropout rate of girls.
The infrastructure of high schools is relatively
poor, particularly in north Karnataka, as
the average index (0.37) of these districts
is below the average index of the state
(0.42). In 2002-03, 54 per cent of schools
did not have any toilets and 68 per cent of
schools did not have separate toilets for
girls.
Examination results indicate that government
and rural high schools do not perform as well
as privately managed schools and urban
schools. With government schools catering
to low socio-economic groups, girls, SCs
and STs and rural areas, this is a matter of
concern.

Karnataka has dealt
satisfactorily with the

goals. Retention and
quality of learning are
more complex and
challenging goals, since
they need varied and

while the first two

– largely need physical/

join should complete secondary education’
is yet to be achieved as only 40 per cent
of those who joined completed secondary
education in the state in 2003-04.
The increasing popularity of private schools
can be a cause for concern from an equity
perspective. This preference for private
(unaided) schools is most visible in urban
areas, where parents seem to prefer them
to government schools, wherever they can
afford them.
Currently, vocational education lacks the
mechanisms for responding quickly to
changing market demands. Certain courses
are under-subscribed in polytechnics and
many courses have shut down in the
department of Vocational Education.
Vocational courses have become stopovers for
tertiary education instead of being terminal
points.

Recommendations
While the state has
achieved its target of 50
per cent women teachers,
their over-concentration in
urban areas will have to
be corrected.

The quality of
decision-making in the
administration would be
significantly enhanced if
an EMIS was available at
state, district, taluk and
village levels.

124

While literacy rates in urban Karnataka are very
good, the literacy levels of the rural population,
women, SCs and STs, and more particularly SC
and ST women indicate that the state is far from
reaching theTenth Plan goals. Literacy levels in the
northeastern districts are considerably below the
state and national averages.The hiatus in national
spending and targeting of low-performing areas
and groups must give way to a renewed focus on
adult education.
The goals of access, enrolment, retention, are in
a way sequential, in the sense that each goal
needs to be significantly achieved before the next
can be meaningfully addressed. Karnataka has
dealt satisfactorily with the access and enrolment
goals. Retention and quality of learning are more
complex and challenging goals, since they need
varied and qualitative strategies while the first two
— access and enrolment — largely need physical/
quantitative remedies. Physical/quantitative goals
are easier to achieve than qualitative/soft goals.
Most vulnerable to dropping out of school are girls
from all social classes, the poor and the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes. Geographically, the northern
districts and especially the Hyderabad Karnataka
region have poor education indicators. Focused

targeting of these marginal sub-populations thus
becomes necessary.
Infrastructure facilities, particularly classrooms,
separate toilets for girls and drinking water
should be provided to all schools on a priority
basis. Lack of these facilities could negatively
impact retention, especially of girls. Though toilets
have been constructed in many schools, they have
become unworkable without water supply. Hence,
construction of toilets must go hand in hand with
providing water facilities. In addition, upgradation
of laboratories and libraries in high schools should
be taken up.
The proportion of female teachers in rural schools
is about half of that in urban schools with a few
exceptions in some south Karnataka districts.
Thus, while the state has achieved its target of 50
per cent women teachers, their over-concentration
in urban areas will have to be corrected to ensure
that rural primary schools do not suffer from a
shortage of women teachers.
From a governance perspective, there will have
to be concerted efforts to ensure that teachers
do not absent themselves from school, even
for authorised purposes. In a single teacher or
multi-grade school, this means that the school
effectively closes down. Good governance is
the critical factor here in curbing indiscipline,
whether it is in ensuring that schools in remote,
underserved areas get teachers and these
teachers actually report for work or in curbing
absenteeism and encouraging committed
teachers to perform well.
The quality of decision-making in the
administration would be significantly enhanced
if an EMIS (Education Management Information
System) was available to administration at the
state, district, taluk and village levels. For instance,
information on the current status of teacher
vacancies and absenteeism, training and training
needs would help administrators significantly.
Panchayat Raj institutions (PRI) and community
support to schools for fully achieving the goals
of education can be split into two categories

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

– ‘hard’ factors such as infrastructure, enrolment,
attendance and ‘soft’ factors such as quality of
teaching-learning. Gram panchayats and School
Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs)
will have to play an important role in infrastructure
creation and supporting enrolment and attendance
of both teachers and students, while department
officers provide academic/pedagogic input.

by recruiting more women high school teachers
as in primary levels, providing schools with basic
infrastructure (68 per cent of high schools do not
have separate toilets for girls) and by building
awareness in the community. Otherwise, girls
who constitute a high percentage of dropouts are
likely to lose out even more when the influx to
secondary education begins.

Village level tracking systems must be put in place
to monitor dropouts and out-of-school children. It
would mean that panchayat institutions, community
based organisations like the SDMC and departments,
viz. Education, Labour and Rural Development,
must organise a platform of interventions to ensure
that children enroll and stay on in school.

The infrastructure of high schools is poor, especially
in the northern districts. A high 54 per cent of
the schools do not have any toilet whatsoever.
Laboratories are so ill-equipped that Science
practicals are not conducted in the S.S.L.C.
examinations to ensure against urban bias. Many
high schools do not even have furniture for class
rooms. Hence these facilities will have to be
provided.

School adoption is a programme that should be
more fully explored. The department should make
the ‘School Adoption Programme’ easily accessible
to individuals and institutions all over the country,
and to NRIs in particular. The Internet can be a
relevant medium to promote this programme
world wide. School adoption could focus on the
infrastructure needs of the school.
In secondary education, government must take
steps now itself to accommodate the large stream
of students who will seek admission to high schools
in the wake of its successful implementation of the
Sarva Shikshan Abhiyan programme.
The tremendous attrition in secondary education
is due in part to lack of proper evaluation at the
primary level that lets most students pass through
the system, sometimes without having attained
minimum levels of learning. Bridge courses for
such children would ensure that they do not drop
out. The dropout rate at the secondary level is
about 60 per cent by the time students reach class
X. The low percentage of female teachers, lack of
infrastructure, especially separate toilets for girls,
and above all, social restrictions on girls once they
attain puberty, are contributory factors. This is a
difficult challenge that needs to be effectively
tackled to ensure that the benefits of education
reach girls. The education of girls is known to
have immense emancipatory and empowerment
potential, hence this must be accorded high priority

The tenth class has been conceptualised as a
terminal point for those who wish to discontinue
studies to enter the world of work. However, the
vocation/job opportunities for those who complete
secondary education is limited. This is another
complex area that needs attention. Students who
leave the education stream after completing class
X do not have sufficient skills, vocational and
communicative, to take up meaningful jobs. All too
often, they become alienated from their traditional
occupations such as agriculture. Incorporating
a vocational base to secondary education has
been tried several times and failed for various
reasons such as lack of relevance to market needs,
inflexibility of curricula and lack of trained teachers.
However, this is one area, which needs to be readdressed from a fresh perspective.
Vocational education has had its successes when
it has responded to the market, as in the case
of IT-based diplomas or Commercial Practice,
which is popular with girls as they get jobs almost
immediately. The older vocations such as civil and
mechanical engineering have seen a decline in
demand: these courses should be revamped, and
retraining teachers should go hand-in-hand with
this strategy. Developing vocational courses for
dropouts from the school system also needs to be
prioritised.

Village tracking systems
must be put in place to
monitor dropouts and
out-of-school children.
