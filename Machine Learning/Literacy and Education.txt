Literacy and Education

CHAPTER 5

Literacy and Education
Introduction
Education is recognised as a fundamental human
right, along with other necessities, such as food,
shelter and water in The Universal Declaration on
Human Rights (1948). The advantages it confers
on individuals and nations are multi-dimensional
and multi-faceted. It sustains economic growth
by providing basic as well as specialised skills
that ensure increased productivity and higher
per capita incomes. Human development is
predicated upon universal access to education,
with its implications for equity and social justice.
Education empowers people to make informed
choices about their lives and about their rights
as citizens in a democracy. Gender justice gets
a boost when women have access to education,
which, by enhancing women’s knowledge and
employment capacity, increases their sense of
autonomy and self worth. People’s health status
improves as their education levels rise. Above all,
education is valued, quite simply, for itself and
the avenues of knowledge and awareness that
it opens for us.
Achievements in education in Karnataka have
been quite remarkable, and the state is moving
towards universal literacy at a steady pace. The
literacy rate increased from 56.04 per cent in
1991 to 66.64 per cent in 2001, with the female
literacy rate increasing more swiftly than the
male literacy rate. Overall, the gender disparity
in literacy is declining rather perceptibly and
the decline is much more evident in the less
economically developed districts of the state.
Karnataka has 51,904 primary schools (2003-04)
and the number of habitations with primary schools
within a distance of one kilometre increased from
84 per cent in 1993 to 88 per cent in 2002.
Enrolment in primary education grew at the rate of
one per cent for boys and two per cent for girls per
annum from 1990-91 to 2003-04. The dropout
rate for Classes I to IV came down from a high 31
per cent in 1993-94 to six per cent in 2001-02, but
increased thereafter, to 11 per cent in 2003-04.
For classes I to VIII, the dropout rate declined

from 54-59 per cent between 1992 and 2000
to 45.4 per cent in 2003-04. Karnataka has
taken steps to recruit women teachers, whose
numbers went up to 54 per cent in 2003-04.
At present there exists an extensive high school
network in the state and the midday meal scheme
covers nearly 66 lakh children in classes I to VII, in
both government and aided schools. As many as
1,088 high schools have computer-aided learning
centres, thereby bringing information technology
within the reach of rural students.
The constraints and challenges will have to be
confronted head-on. Overall, the mean years
of schooling have improved only marginally
over a four-year period, from 1999-2000 to
2003-04. The high levels of regional, caste and
gender disparities imply that not all the children
in the state have equal access to education.
The dropout rate in south Karnataka districts
in 2003-04 was lower than the state average
as well as north Karnataka’s average for boys
and girls. In terms of infrastructure in primary
schools, Hyderabad Karnataka performs poorly
while south Karnataka has better infrastructure
than other regions. More than 3 per cent schools

improvement over the years. The quality of
instruction and instructional material will have to
improve considerably to ensure better retention
of students.
As noted in chapter 3, from 1990-91 to 2002-03,
the largest allocation of public education
expenditure went to general education, and
primary and secondary education within
general education, a pattern which reflects the
government’s priorities. Despite this, the share
of primary and secondary education in the
state income and in the education budget has
been more or less static. The combined public
expenditure ratio (PER) and the social allocation
ratio (SAR) for primary and secondary education
has straggled along at around 2.4 per cent and
13.3 per cent for over 12 years. While the state
government has, quite rightly, prioritised primary

and secondary education in terms of resources,
the overwhelmingly large share of revenue
expenditure in total expenditure indicates that,
in Karnataka, as in other southern states, not
enough investment is being directed towards
capital expenditure. The non-salary component is
low and the expenditure on school infrastructure,
curriculum development, instructional material,
in-service teachers’ training – in short, all the
elements that contribute to improving the quality
of education – is inadequate.

Literacy
Literacy’s positive association with improved
socio-economic development indicators, as well
as some demographic indicators, underlines its
crucial role in the process of human development.
Attainment of literacy improves people’s
productivity by strengthening their knowledge
and skill base, and this, in turn, increases their
income. The coefficient of correlation between
the population below the poverty line and the
female literacy rate in rural areas is –0.62,
indicating clearly that poverty and female
illiteracy are very closely linked (Table 5.1).
There is also likely to be greater improvement
in women’s status when their literacy levels
rise: for instance, there is a positive correlation
(0.28) between female literacy and the sex ratio
(Table 5.1). This is apparent from the situation
prevailing in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi
districts, which have the highest sex ratio in the
state, as well as a very high female literacy rate.
Karnataka’s literacy rate (66.64) has increased by
10 percentage points between 1991 and 2001.
Its literacy rate has been consistently higher than
all-India in all census years and is even higher than
the literacy rate in some neighbouring countries
such as Pakistan (44.0), Bangladesh (40.10)
and Nepal (39.20), but lower than Sri Lanka
(91.10). Karnataka, however, still has to catch
up with its neighbours, Kerala (90.9),Tamil Nadu
(73.5) and Maharashtra (76.9). The scenario in
Karnataka is somewhat mixed. About one-third
of the state’s population is still illiterate; the
illiteracy rate is more than 63 per cent and 58
per cent respectively among Scheduled Tribe
and Scheduled Caste females. As many as 15

districts (9 in north Karnataka and 6 in south
Karnataka) have a literacy rate that is below the
state average and 11 districts are even below
the national average, ranging from Raichur with
48.8 per cent to Mysore with 63.48 per cent.
One encouraging feature is that the female
literacy rate increased more rapidly (around
28 per cent) from 1991 to 2001 than the male
literacy rate (around 14 per cent). The gender
disparity in literacy has declined steadily over
the years, from 0.47 in 1961 to 0.19 in 2001,
indicating significant progress in the reduction
of female illiteracy. Another trend, which is
reflective of the success of policy interventions,
is the sharp decline in gender disparity in the
rural areas of even the relatively less developed
region of Hyderabad Karnataka. While the
literacy-gender disparity is higher in rural areas

Literacy rates in the various districts of the state
have improved significantly in 2001. The coastal
districts of Dakshina Kannada (83.35) and Udupi
(81.25) along with Bangalore Urban district
(82.96) continued to maintain their lead status as
high performers, well on the way to catching up
with Kerala, while four districts of the Hyderabad
Karnataka region were below the all-India
literacy rate in respect of total, male and female
literacy levels in both census years (1991 and
2001). The malnad districts of Kodagu (77.99),
Shimoga (74.52) and Chikmaglur (72.20)
maintained a steady growth in the literacy rate.
Within Hyderabad Karnataka, Bidar, despite
being below the state average, emerged as the
best performing district (60.94), while Raichur
occupied the lowest position in both census years.
Bijapur’s literacy rate was higher than the all-India
literacy rate in 1991, but regressed below the
all-India male, female and total literacy levels
in 2001. Other districts, which showed similar
deterioration and fell below the national literacy
rate, are Chitradurga (male and total literacy),
Bagalkot (male), Gadag (female) and Belgaum
(total literacy). It is possible that this somewhat
grim scenario is the outcome of the bifurcation
of certain districts (viz. Chitradurga, Bijapur
and Dharwad) in 1997, whereby pre-existing
intra-district differentials in literacy became
sharply outlined. The less developed Hyderabad
Karnataka districts gave cause to rejoice, having
registered the most marked improvements in
literacy in the state with the highest increases in
decennial growth: Raichur (3.58), Koppal (3.53)
and Bidar (3.05), while the lowest was Bijapur
with 0.13. Even Chamarajnagar, one of the most
underdeveloped districts in south Karnataka,
managed to improve its performance from 38.19
per cent in 1991 to 50.87 per cent in 2001.
The low female literacy rate in Karnataka, as in
India, is a visible manifestation of gender bias,
which refuses to acknowledge women’s inherent
right to education. Caste, class and geographical
factors are other sources of inequity that shape

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

female literacy levels. This becomes evident when
the inter-district performance in female literacy is
analysed. The highest female literacy rates are to
be found in Bangalore Urban (77.48), Dakshina
Kannada (77.21), and Udupi (75.19) districts,
and the lowest in Raichur (35.93), Gulbarga
(37.90) and Koppal (39.61). Geographically,
Gulbarga, Raichur and Koppal are contiguous and
share the same socio-economic characteristics
of underdevelopment, while Dakshina Kannada
and Udupi (which were originally one district)
have traditionally maintained good human
development indicators. The female literacy rate
in Bangalore Rural was a low 54.99 per cent –
lower than the state average, and lower than some
southern districts such as Davangere (58.04) or
Tumkur (56.94), which do not have the advantage
of lying in the immediate periphery of India’s
fastest growing city. Figure 5.1 shows the rural
female literacy rate between different districts of
the state and reveals wide variations between
north and south Karnataka. The mean literacy
rate of the districts of north Karnataka2 (60.99
per cent) is less than that of south Karnataka3
(69.52 per cent). There has been a sharp decline

in the variation (as reflected through coefficient of
variation) during the decade among districts, both
in the south (17.17 per cent in 1991 and 13.18
per cent in 2001) and the north (20.94 per cent in
1991 and 13.97 per cent in 2001). The variation
in literacy over the decade has been narrowing for
all caste groups. In Hyderabad Karnataka, female
literacy rates in rural areas reveal significant
improvements (the maximum in the state) in all
the districts during this period, showing that the
initiatives taken in the state have started bearing
fruit in recent years.
The literacy rate of rural females in Karnataka
is lower than that of urban females, as the
urban female literacy rate grew at a faster rate
than the rural female literacy rate. Raichur and
Koppal have the lowest urban female literacy
rates in Karnataka. As many as 10 districts in
north Karnataka and four districts of south
Karnataka have a rural female literacy rate that
is below the state average. The poor performing
districts in Bombay Karnataka are Bijapur and
Bagalkot while Raichur and Gulbarga are the
low performers in Hyderabad Karnataka and

In Hyderabad Karnataka,
female literacy rates
in rural areas reveal
significant improvements.

Literacy and Education

Chamarajnagar in south Karnataka (Appendix
Tables: Series 4).

The lowest gender
disparity in literacy is in
Bangalore Urban and the
highest in Raichur.

The gender disparity index has been calculated
by using Sophers’ disparity index where a high
index means high gender disparity. A noticeable
and welcome element is the fact that the gender
disparity in literacy has declined sharply over
the decade. The lowest gender disparity is in
Bangalore Urban and the highest disparity is
in Raichur. While gender disparity in literacy is
higher in north Karnataka than in south Karnataka,
it would be simplistic to say gender disparities are
insignificant in the southern districts. The female
literacy rate in Bangalore Rural district may have
improved over the decade, but it is still too low for
a district that has the advantage of being adjacent
to an urban centre.The intensity of difference may
be less in the southern districts, but the disparity
does exist and has serious effects on female
health and poverty. While it is reassuring to note
that, overall, the gender disparity in literacy is
declining and that the decline is faster in the more
underdeveloped regions, more policy interventions
are required if Karnataka is to meet the MDG
(Figure 5.2).
Since the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
populations are characterised by low literacy
rates, districts with high SC and ST populations
tend to have lower literacy rates than others (see
chapters 9 and 10).

State interventions
One reason for the existence of such high levels
of illiteracy in India, even today, when it is poised
to become a super power in this millennium, is
the low priority accorded to both adult literacy
and primary education in the post-Independence
years. The institutions of higher learning
established in those years have contributed
immeasurably to the country’s emergence as a
leader in the current knowledge-based global
economy, but the lack of policy seriousness in
tackling illiteracy as a grassroots movement
meant that increases in literacy levels took place
incrementally. The National Adult Education
Programme (NAEP), launched in 1978, was a
national programme to remove illiteracy, under
which funds were made available to states to
set up departments of adult education. The next
initiative, the National Literacy Mission 1988,
was launched in the then popular mission mode.
The Literacy Mission used a community based
approach to address adult illiteracy, drawing upon
volunteers and NGOs and using catchy tactics
such as jathas and street theatre to mobilise
people. In some states, the Literacy Mission met
with unexpected success in mobilising women
around social issues, as in the anti-arrack
agitation in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh. This kind
of social activism on this scale can be described
as true education (through empowerment) in
the broadest sense of the term. However, the
outcomes of the efforts of the NLM, when viewed

In Karnataka, Bijapur and Dakshina Kannada
were the first two districts to be selected for
implementation of the NLM. Their relative
performances are given in Table 5.5. It is now
recognised that the NLM could neither eradicate
illiteracy, as promised, nor make a spectacular
impact in Bijapur.

Post Literacy Campaign in all districts, continuing
education programmes are now being run in 18
districts. At the village level, there are Continuing
Education Centres (CEC) and Nodal Continuing
Education Centres (NCEC) at the taluk level.
Currently there are 1,513 NCECs and 14,145
CECs in the state. This lull in financing adult
literacy programmes by the Centre needs serious
rethinking when 33 per cent of the population is
still illiterate.

Decennial growth in literacy: Bijapur and Dakshina
Kannada districts - 1991 and 2001
(Per cent)

Looking ahead, it may be noted that in 2001, the
literacy rate in urban and rural Karnataka was
80.58 and 59.33 per cent respectively, hence
the Tenth Plan goal of 75 per cent literacy rate
has already been met, in the urban areas at least,
although it will take some time for the rural areas
to catch up.The rate of increase in the literacy rate
in the rural areas between 1991 and 2001 was
about 12 percentage points and at this rate, ceteris
paribus, Karnataka is unlikely to meet the Tenth
Plan goal of literacy in the rural areas. Furthermore,
the goal of reducing the gender gap in literacy
by 50 per cent by 2007 can be achieved only
through strong policy initiatives. Between 1991
and 2001, the gender gap in literacy reduced by
only 3.1 and 3.76 percentage points in the rural
and urban areas of Karnataka respectively. Hence,
adult education needs another boost if the MDG
and Tenth Plan goals are to be fulfilled. A change
in strategy, which addresses the issue bottom–up,
i.e. from the gram panchayat up, is critical to the
success of adult literacy programmes.

Education
This section will focus on school education from
primary, up to and inclusive of plus-two education.

Tertiary education is a vast sphere, encompassing
as it does, diverse fields such as professional
courses as well as general education. A plethora
of issues has emerged in higher education such as
financing, autonomy, governance, and quality – all
in the context of equity and social justice. It would
be difficult to address all these complex issues
within the confines of this chapter. The Task Force
on Higher Education (2004) has dealt with these
aspects of higher education very comprehensively.

With an urban literacy
rate of 80.58 per cent,
Karnataka has achieved
the Tenth Plan goal of
75 per cent literacy rate
in the urban areas
at least.

Primary education
The Supreme Court ruling in 1994 that a child has
a fundamental right to free education up to age
14 clearly directs the state government to take
responsibility for universal elementary education
(UEE). The state of Karnataka has made major

strides towards achieving the goal of UEE, which
requires the fulfilment of the following objectives:
(i) universal access to primary schools for all
children; (ii) universal enrolment; (iii) universal
retention; and (iv) universal achievement of
minimum essential levels of learning by all
children.

Access and enrolment
Karnataka has 51,904 primary schools (classes
I to VIII) in 2003-04, of which 43,447 are
government schools. Districts with the largest
number of primary schools are Kolar (3,940),
Tumkur (3,878), Belgaum (3,465) and Bangalore
Urban (3,242). However, the number of primary
schools by habitation is a better indicator of access
than mere numbers of schools. The number of
habitations with primary schools within a distance
of one kilometre increased from 84 per cent in
1993 to 88 per cent in 2002 (Seventh All-India
Education Survey: 2002). South Karnataka
schools generally serve smaller populations per
habitation (509) than north Karnataka schools
(1,024), with the exception of Uttara Kannada,
according to the Sixth All-India Education Survey.
In certain districts viz. Shimoga, Chikmaglur,
Hassan and Uttara Kannada, less than 75 per cent
of the habitations have a primary school within
a distance of one kilometre. These districts are
situated in the Western Ghats, where habitations
are small and widely dispersed. In most of the north
Karnataka districts, however, 90 to 99 per cent of
the habitations have a primary school within a
distance of one kilometre, due in part to the fact
that habitations are large and concentrated, but
also as an outcome of policies and projects in this
region (Table 5.6).
The government is the dominant provider of
primary education in Karnataka. The role of the
private sector is minimal, but it has registered
some growth in recent times. In 1990-91, about
89 per cent of all primary schools were government
schools, five per cent were private schools, which
received grants from the government, and six
per cent were unaided schools. By 2003-04,
aided schools and unaided schools constituted
4.83 per cent and 11.46 per cent respectively and
government schools constituted 83.71 per cent of

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

the total number of schools, indicating a modest
increase in the number of unaided schools and a
relative decline in the proportion of government
schools over a period of 13 years. The number of
private unaided schools in the state increased at a
compound growth rate of eight per cent per annum
during the period 1990-91 to 2003-04 while
aided schools and government schools increased
at 1.8 and 1.5 per cent respectively during the
same period. This suggests that there is now a
slight increase in the demand for unsubsidised,
primary schools but overall, the government’s
role as provider of education to the poor and
the vulnerable has not diminished significantly.
The absolute number of government schools has
increased, hence the government’s proactive role
continues. Districts with the highest percentage
of government primary schools (classes I to VIII)
are Udupi (95.05), Chikmaglur (91.63), Haveri
(91.59) and Bangalore Rural (91.00) (Appendix
Tables : Series 4) Table 5.7 reinforces this position:
the demand for private schooling is urban-driven
with a high concentration (34.1 per cent) of
private, unaided schools in urban areas where the
distribution of government schools is low at 47.4
per cent. Predictably, Bangalore Urban district
has the highest percentage (38.74) of private
unaided schools. Providers of private schooling
do not find it profitable to establish institutions in
rural areas where the population is predominantly
low-income and where habitations can be
both small and dispersed. The responsibility of
educating the poor is shouldered by the state
and any fallback here would have adverse
consequences for the attainment of UEE.

BOX 5.5

Enrolment in primary education (classes I to VII)
grew at the rate of 1.4 per cent, encompassing
growth of one per cent for boys and two per cent
for girls per annum, from 1990-91 to 2003-04,
indicating that girls’ education has received
an impetus. Girls’ enrolment grew from 36
per cent of the total enrolment in 1980-81
to 48 per cent in 2003-04. Bijapur, which
had the lowest rank among all the districts
in girls’ enrolment in 1997-98 (KHDR 1999),
continues to be the lowest ranked district in
2003-04, although enrolment increased from
42.2 per cent in 1997-98 to 46.8 per cent in

Learning via satellite
The Edusat Primary Education Project is a pilot project in distance education in primary education
and the first of its kind in the country. It is being implemented in collaboration with ISRO.
The infrastructure consists of a central hub at Bangalore and Receive only Terminals (ROTs)
with 29 sets in 885 schools in the educationally backward district of Chamarajnagar. Education
programmes uplinked from the hub are received via the Edusat satellite in all schools
simultaneously.
Edusat’s objectives are:

To bring in quality improvement in classroom transactions at the primary level;

To make learning child centred, interesting and motivating;

To supplement classroom teaching with audio-visual support;

To take children through real life situations;

To give students access to the best teachers in every field;

To ensure that ‘difficult’ topics in every subject are easily understood by children;

To provide inputs in non-curricular areas for the overall development of children;

To encourage teachers to develop teaching learning materials (TLM) and use them
effectively in classrooms.

Involving parents and the community
In 2001, School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs) replaced the Village
Education Committees (VECs) in Karnataka. An SDMC has a 3-year term. SDMCs comprise
nine elected parent members, four ex-officio members and six nominated members (including
students) to ensure parental and community involvement and participation in the day to day
activities of schools. A committee meets once a month to review the functioning of the school.

A study found:

85 per cent of the parents rated the functioning of SDMCs as good;
83 per cent of the parents attend meetings every month;
30 per cent of the teachers said that SDMCs have been effective in carrying out
improvements to schools through collective participation;
According to 28 per cent of the parents, the SDMC has a positive impact on retention,
attendance and enrolment;
Around 30 per cent of the parents said that SDMCs have improved the functioning of the
midday meal scheme;
79 per cent of the students reported that SDMC members visit schools regularly;
87 per cent of the students reported that SDMC members visit classes, verify whether
teachers conduct classes and randomly test some of the learning competencies; and
More than 70 per cent of the presidents of committees said that they have attempted to
bring out-of-school children back to school.

Contributed by SDMCs (2002-03):

38 per cent have contributed towards land and buildings;
26 per cent have provided teaching learning materials (TLMs); and
19 per cent have contributed cash.

Every day one family supplies the vegetables and coconuts required for the midday meal served
at the Government Lower Primary School, Jumbebeta, 40 km from Honnavara. The community
has constructed a separate dining room. In fact, the community itself started the school, which
the government later took over. The school is situated amid the thick forests of Uttara Kannada
district. Despite the distance factor and geographical location the community has ensured that
the school has furniture like benches, chairs, cupboards, etc. It cleans the playground through

shramadana.

Then and now...what a change!
Old timers say this higher primary school at Sivarampet in Mysore looked like a cowshed.
However, today it has been transformed by the local committee. This SDMC has formed
sub-committees to look after the various developmental activities of the school. It has provided a
range of facilities like drinking water, toilets, classrooms, power, a garden, teaching and learning
material, sports equipment, gymnasium, a computer and books.

2003-04. There is not much variation between
districts in girls’ enrolment. Mandya has the
highest enrolment of ST girls and Gulbarga the
lowest enrolment for SC girls. Enrolment was the
highest in Bangalore Urban and the lowest in
Bellary, though it may be noted that there is not
much difference between the highest and lowest
enrolment numbers.
Gross and net enrolment ratios capture the
multiple dimensions of schooling. It is useful
to distinguish between the concept of gross
enrolment and net enrolment rate. Generally, the
gross and net enrolment ratios are used to capture
child schooling. The enrolment rate is defined as
the number of children enrolled in school divided
by the child population in the relevant age group.
The gross enrolment rate (GER) includes children
at a given educational level who may be over or
under-aged relative to the age group used as a
divisor. The net enrolment rate (NER) is obtained
by dividing the number of children in the relevant
age group enrolled in a particular stage by the
total child population in that specified age group.
The GER may, therefore, exceed 100 per cent.
The GER of the state increased from 92 in 1996-97
to 99 in 2000-01 and fell to 94.14 in 2003-04. In
1998-99, Raichur had the lowest GER and Udupi
the highest. In 2000-01, there was no change
in the status of Raichur where the GER (74.54)
was still the lowest, while Bangalore Urban
(128.21) was the highest. During 2003-04,
Dakshina Kannada had the highest GER and
Raichur still had the lowest GER. Bidar’s GER has
improved markedly particularly the GER of girls,

which is now on a par with their male counterparts.
Across castes, the GER of the Scheduled Tribes
(STs) is lower than that of the general population
and the Scheduled Castes (SCs). In fact, there has
been a great improvement in the GER of the SCs,
which has overtaken the general population in
2000-01, and which is a direct outcome of the
government’s special incentive schemes. Some
introspection and remedial action is called for
with regard to the STs, who have a different set of
problems altogether.
Table 5.8 reveals that all north Karnataka districts
have very high net enrolment ratios. In 2004-05,
Bidar for example, has an NER of 130 for classes
I to V and 131 for classes VI to VII, the highest in
the state.
The high GER and NER figures indicate that
the first two objectives – universal access and
enrolment – have largely been achieved, and
increased attention is now required in the areas of
retention/attendance and quality of learning.

The dropout rate is an indicator of the efficiency
of the primary school system since it presents an
overview of the wastage of human resources.
Non-attendance and/or dropping-out are the
outcomes of a combination of factors at the
individual, institutional and structural levels.
Structurally, poverty means that parents cannot
afford the opportunity costs, preferring to put
their children to work, either at home or for other
people. For girls, gender disparity combines with
poverty to keep them out of school for a variety of
reasons, ranging from early marriage to using girls
for housework and sibling care. Lack of parental
support, caused largely by the parents’ own low
education levels and lack of motivation, is another
strong inhibiting factor. If schools are far from the
habitation or have inadequate infrastructure with
reference to classrooms, toilets for girls and drinking
water, then parents feel discouraged.Within schools,
multi-grade teaching, poor instructional quality,
teacher absenteeism, repetition and the lack of

The high GER and NER
figures indicate that the
objectives of universal
access and enrolment have
largely been achieved.

TABLE 5.8

Net enrolment ratio
Retention
The mean years of schooling are used as an
indicator of levels of educational attainment.
Overall, the mean years of schooling have
improved only marginally over a four year period,
from 3.97 in 1999-2000 to 4.25 in 2003-04, and
there is little difference between boys and girls.
Across social groups the mean years of schooling
of Scheduled Tribe students is slightly lower than
the Scheduled Castes as well as the non-SC and
non-ST students.
Boys out-perform girls among the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes, but overall, there is no significant
difference in the mean years of schooling for girls
and boys in the non-SC and non-ST group. Ten
districts (all 5 districts of Hyderabad Karnataka;
Chamarajnagar, Davangere, Bijapur, Bagalkot,
and Belgaum) are below the state average for
mean years of schooling for girls in 2003-04. If
free education up to the age of 14, as mandated
in the Constitution, is taken as the norm, then all
children must have eight mean years of schooling,
and current achievement levels, therefore, fall well
short of this objective.

This year, the Government High School in the Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bangalore
was adjudged the best secondary school providing computer education in the state and was
honoured by the President of India.
This success story has been replicated in 1,000 government secondary schools across the state
where computer learning has become a way of life for nearly 4,00,000 children over the past
4 years.
Quarterly evaluations of the programme are being regularly conducted by the Computer Science
departments of local engineering colleges under the guidance of the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore. Teachers in these schools are trained in computer application, thereby enhancing
their teaching skills.

correlation between education and market-based
job skills are some factors that encourage dropouts.
This combination of factors means that 45 out of
100 children enrolled in class I are likely to drop
out by class VIII.
The dropout rate increases as students move up
from class I: 2003-04 figures show that out of
100 children who enrolled in class I, 11 per cent
dropped out by the end of class IV, 29 per cent
dropped out by the end of class VII and 45 per cent
by the end of class VIII. The survival rate of
children in the higher classes declines even
more sharply. The dropout rate for classes I to
IV ranged from a high 31 per cent in 1993-94
to 6 per cent in 2001-02; for classes I to VII,
it fluctuated between 52.8 per cent (1993-94)
to 29 per cent (2003-04); for classes I to VIII,
the dropout rate has been fairly high from
1992-93 to 1999-2000 (59 to 54 per cent),
before it dropped to 45.4 per cent in 2003-04
(Figure 5.5).
Poverty has been identified as one of the main
reasons for high dropout rates since the poor
cannot afford the opportunity costs of education.
However, there are other facets of this issue. The
dropout rate for girls is invariably higher than
that of boys in all classes. While there has been a
decline in the dropout rate over the years, for both
boys and girls, the decline is more perceptible for
boys, who are regarded as socio-economic assets
by the family and investing in their education is
perceived as producing favourable outcomes by
way of enhanced vocational skills and higher wages.
Investing in girls’ education is not high priority,
partly because it does not benefit the birth family
directly, but mainly because women are treated as
marginal beings who can be pulled out of school
to manage the home and assist in sibling care.
Figure 5.6 indicates the dropout rate for both boys
and girls. The dropout rate for the state is further
shaped by regional disparities. The dropout rate
in the districts of south Karnataka in 2003-04 is
lower than both the state average and the average
for north Karnataka, for boys, girls and all children.
Even in north Karnataka itself, there are gaps
between the Hyderabad Karnataka and Bombay
Karnataka regions.The dropout rate in the districts

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

of Hyderabad Karnataka, which was 56.5 per cent
(1999-2000) and 46.7 per cent (2003-04),
was markedly higher than 36.8 per cent
(1999-2000) and 29.7 per cent (2003-04) in
the districts of the Bombay Karnataka region. The
gender gap in the dropout rate is very high in the
northern districts whereas it has been steadily
dwindling in the southern districts. The sharp
decline in the dropout rate can be attributed to the
concerted efforts of the state to enroll all eligible
children, retain them in school and to bring back
out-of-school children into either the formal or a
non-formal system. Many of these schemes target
the educationally backward districts of the state.

BOX 5.8

Initiatives for north Karnataka
On the basis of the recommendations of the
Report for the Redressal of Regional Imbalances
(2002), certain actions have been initiated to
improve education indicators in the northern
districts of the state:
 Separate
Additional Commissionerates
of Public Instruction were established at
Belgaum and Gulbarga in 2003-04;
 Separate Regional Secondary Examination
Boards were established at Belgaum and
Gulbarga.
 The cooked midday meals programme was
initially launched in 9,724 government
primary schools in the northern districts of
Karnataka during 2001-02;
 50 per cent of the non-salary grants of the
state education budget under primary and
secondary heads have been earmarked for north Karnataka from 2001-02 onwards;
 2,587 posts of primary school teachers were moved from other parts of the state during
2001-02 and 2002-03 to this region to improve the pupil–teacher ratio.
 The pupil-teacher ratio in north Karnataka districts came down from 42.04 in the year
2001-02 to 40.97 in the year 2003-04;
 Large education districts were bifurcated to improve efficiency.

According to the Children’s Census conducted by
the Department of Public Instruction in 2005, the
highest percentage of out-of-school children in the
age group 7-14 is among STs and SCs. These two
social classes also have the highest percentage of
out-of-school girls.
The state has a gamut of schemes directed at
ensuring universal enrolment and retention. Under
the Vidya Vikasa programme, school children in
classes I to VII get free text books and uniforms.
Akshara Dasoha, the midday meals scheme, was
initially introduced in seven northern districts and
was subsequently extended to cover all children
in classes I to VII in both government-and privateaided schools.This helps over 60 lakh children and
the expenditure is of the order of Rs.280 crore.
For girls, there are attendance scholarships.
Karnataka has pioneered various schemes for
bringing out-of-school children back to school.
The schemes directly address all the major
constraints faced by out-of-school children and
their families. They are Chinnara Angala (bringing
out-of-school children back to school), Coolienda
Shalege (for child labour), flexi schools (night
schools for working children), mobile schools (for
slum children), Beediyinda Shalege (for street
children), Baa Baale Shalege (for the girl child),
Kishori Kendra (residential bridge courses for girls
in Bellary and Koppal), and Samudayadatta Shale
(community rallies). These schemes have enabled
the state to mainstream a number of out-ofschool children into primary education. Chinnara

How to guarantee learning
The Learning Guarantee Programme is co-managed by the Government of Karnataka and the
Azim Premji Foundation with the goal of creating willingness among schools and communities
to come forward and be evaluated on the criteria of enrolment, attendance and learning
achievements of children. Schools that satisfy the criteria are eligible for awards.The programme
aims to inspire and motivate teachers and schools to develop classroom practices and processes
that enable every child to learn.
The programme was launched in 8 education districts of north Karnataka – Bellary, Bijapur,
Bagalkot, Raichur, Bidar, Gulbarga, Yadgir and Koppal. Participation in the programme was
voluntary and open to all primary and upper primary schools that chose to participate. As many as
6,484 schools sent in applications expressing an interest to participate in the programme and 896
schools volunteered for assessment in 2003 with the number increasing to 1,443 in 2004.

1,888 schools (20 per cent of the government schools) are participating in the
programme;
Over 2,00,000 children were tested;
82 schools won the Learning Guarantee Programme Award for 2004;
The average pupil–teacher ratio (PTR) in the winning schools is 28.5 against the north
Karnataka average of 43;
11 per cent of the lower primary schools (LPS) evaluated were winners vs. 3 per cent
higher primary schools;
While 24 schools that won in 2003 did not win again in 2004, 16 schools repeated their
success and 48 schools that did not win in 2003 came out winners in 2004, showing that
schools can improve but must also guard their excellence zealously.

The Lower Primary School at Hanakanahalli, a small village in Bellary district, stands out as
a good example of what dedicated teachers, a supportive SDMC and enlightened parents can
achieve if they work together as a team. The school, which was graded ‘B’ last year, upped its
ante this year and emerged as an ‘A’ grade school. It is also the only school where all its
students demonstrated 100 per cent achievement in Kannada and Mathematics. Yet,
this multi-grade school has just two teachers who manage 33 students studying in five classes
in two rooms, one of which also serves as the office.

Angala has succeeded in mainstreaming more
than half of the total beneficiary children. The
highest proportion of children mainstreamed for
all schemes is in the Hyderabad Karnataka region.
However, even programmes with a small number
of beneficiaries are no less critical since the real
effort lies in enrolling the ‘last mile’ children.
These children are from the most disadvantaged
sections of society – urban street children and
child labourers – whose income is critical to their
families, and getting them into school is a difficult
task (Table 5.11).

Infrastructure
Lack of infrastructure or inadequate infrastructure
is among the factors cited for high dropout rates.
Causes range from lack of classrooms, latrines,
and separate latrines for girls, to not provisioning
safe drinking water. An infrastructure index has
been constructed based on the percentage of
schools run in their own buildings, availability
of electricity, water, common toilets, separate
toilets for girls, pucca buildings/kutcha buildings/
no building. The infrastructure index has been
constructed by using the formula: average of
[(Actual - Min)/(Max - Min)]. Based on this index,
Bangalore Urban district (0.81) tops in terms of
facilities provided to students and Uttar Kannada
(0.20) is last. The extent of the gulf between

Teachers
Ensuring that there is an adequate number of
trained teachers obviously improves the quality of
instruction in schools. In Karnataka, only trained
teachers are recruited, and the department is
conducting in-service training regularly. There has
been a perceptible improvement in the pupil–
teacher ratio (PTR) at the primary level, which
declined from 38 in 1998-99 to 35 in 2003-04,
indicating that Karnataka has now attained the
national norm of 35 students per teacher at the
primary level. Across districts, however, no district
in north Karnataka, except Uttara Kannada, and all
the districts of south Karnataka except Bangalore
Urban and Dakshina Kannada have fulfilled this
norm (Appendix Tables: Series 4). This is probably
because habitations in most of south Karnataka,
as in Uttar Kannada district, are small and widely
dispersed. Within Hyderabad Karnataka, Bidar
has the lowest PTR. Urban schools have a higher
PTR than rural schools, due, in part, to the lower
student strength in rural schools. Managementwise, the PTR for 2003-04 indicates that the
PTR is higher in private aided schools than in
government and unaided schools.The trend shows
that a high PTR is correlated with low enrolment
and a high dropout rate. The Learning Guarantee
Scheme found that the high-performing schools
in north Karnataka had a PTR (28.5) which was
markedly lower than the local average of 43.

TABLE 5.12

Basic infrastructure in primary schools: India and selected states

Infrastructure index values

Bangalore Urban and the second ranking district,
Kodagu, is represented by 0.16 points. Across
regions, Hyderabad Karnataka has the lowest and
south Karnataka the highest infrastructure index.
Within south Karnataka, Chitradurga, Tumkur
and Hassan have lower infrastructure indices
than certain districts of north Karnataka such as
Dharwad and Gadag (Figure 5.7). A study found
that poor school infrastructure not only repelled
students, it also kept teachers away as well (World
Bank 2004). Better infrastructure for teachers
meant availability of teachers’ toilets, electricity,
covered classrooms, non-mud floors and libraries.
In fact, it has been found that schools that are
near paved roads have less teacher absence.

Districts

More than 3 per cent of schools are still without
teachers and 19 per cent schools function

with single teachers (Seventh All-India School
Education Survey, Provisional Statistics, 2002).
This problem is more pronounced in rural areas,
while urban areas often have a glut of teachers.
This affects the quality of instruction and widens
the rural–urban and inter-district disparity in
teaching and learning.
Teacher absenteeism, whether for authorised or
unauthorised reasons, has an adverse effect on
the quality of education. A World Bank survey
(2004) found that nearly 22 per cent of teachers
are absent from government primary schools on a
typical day in Karnataka.
Teachers who are more powerful, defined in this
context, as male, older and better educated, and
head teachers, are more likely to be absent. In
this respect, the survey found that there was not
much difference between government and private
(aided and unaided) school teachers or regular
and contract employees. Multi-grade schools
report a higher incidence of teacher absence. Only
45 per cent of the teachers surveyed were actually
found teaching during the survey. Low teacher
attendance translates into low student attendance
and poor examination scores.

Girls’ education gets a strong impetus with
the presence of female teachers in a school.
Government policy directs that women shall
constitute not less than 50 per cent of teachers
recruited to the state school system. The proportion
of female teachers has, accordingly, increased
from 46 per cent in 1998-99 to 54 per cent in
2003-04. Kodagu has the highest proportion
of female teachers (79.2 per cent) and Bijapur
the lowest (38 per cent) in 2003-04. Dakshina
Kannada has seen a significant improvement in
this regard, from 39.26 per cent in 1998-99 to
73.91 per cent in 2003-04, but the percentage
of female teachers has declined in Bangalore
Urban, Koppal and Udupi districts. The proportion
of women teachers in rural schools is about half of
that in urban schools with a few exceptions. While
this says something about the lack of facilities for
women teachers in rural areas, it also has adverse
gender outcomes in terms of low girls’ enrolment
and retention in rural Karnataka.

Minimum levels of learning
Achievement of certain minimum levels of
learning is the fourth objective of UEE and the
most difficult to attain. Given the huge spread of
the public school system, maintaining uniformity
in instructional quality is a challenging task.
Certain programmes have been introduced by the
government to improve the quality of teaching
and learning. Keli-Kali is an innovative radio
programme for primary school children. The radio
programmes are broadcast across the state to
cover nearly 6.1 million students in classes III
to VI. Its objectives are to provide the benefit of
expert teaching to all students, promote student
teacher interaction and to inculcate in children
an awareness of joyful learning. Songs, local
dialects, folklore and sound effects contribute to
the attractiveness and topicality of the lessons.
With so many multi-grade schools still in
existence, managing uniform levels of learning
in all grades becomes a complex task for the
teacher. Bahumukhi, a training module on
multi-grade and multi-level learning, enables
teachers to implement strategies such as
effective implementation of instructional plan,
activity-based teaching methodology, effective

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

use of teaching and learning material (TLM) and
community resources, co-curricular activities,
classroom management, time management,
Keli-Kali radio lessons and continuous and
comprehensive evaluation, to ensure that students
in multi-grade schools do not lose out on quality.
More recently, the trimester system has been
introduced: (i) to ensure there is continuous and
activity-based learning during the academic
year, through project work; (ii) to render learning
more meaningful and interesting to children, by
including non-cognitive areas such as drawing,
music, yoga, drama and value education in the
curriculum; (iii) to build systems for internal
assessment and evaluation by introducing grades
for evaluation. All these are recent initiatives
directed at improving the quality of instruction and
learning and the real test is whether the system
can be successfully replicated across regions and
schools with varying levels of infrastructure.
Examination scores may not be the best way of
testing a child’s learning skills since the system
itself prioritises rote learning over comprehension
and analysis. At present, however, it is the only
formal system of evaluation of student and teacher
performance and one way of assessing the quality
of instruction is to look at the number of children
who appear for, and pass the examinations
after completing seven years of schooling. The
government has a policy of ‘no detention till
class V’, thereby ensuring that all children who
attend school for a minimum number of days are
promoted to the next higher class, irrespective
of learning achievements. While this policy helps
to keep children in school, thus increasing the
years of schooling and reducing dropouts, its
effect on levels of learning is not satisfactory. The
examination results indicate an improvement in
the pass percentage from 84 per cent in 1997 to
91 per cent in 2002. Despite their high dropout
rate, girls have a better pass percentage than boys.
This trend is manifested across all caste groups,
leading to the inevitable conclusion that the socioeconomic factors that work against retaining girls
in school cause a tremendous waste of human
potential for the individual and the country. Across
districts, Gulbarga had the lowest and Mandya

the highest pass percentage in 2002. There is
little significant difference in the pass percentages
of different caste groups. It is self-evident that
districts with high literacy rates, a low dropout
rate, low PTR and good infrastructure in schools
will perform well in the class VII examination.
Table 5.14 presents a summary of examination
results.

Secondary education
The demand for secondary education is bound
to increase as Karnataka moves steadily
towards universal elementary education. The
demand is likely to peak within a few years
of the inception of the Eleventh Plan period.
The educational sector will have to address the
challenges of universal secondary education by
ensuring budgetary support for putting in place
the infrastructure required to meet the needs of
the most underdeveloped districts of the state,
so that quality does not become a casualty as
the system expands its outreach. Universal
access is emerging as a critical concern since
denial of quality education to children because
of gender, economic class, caste and geographic
location raises serious equity issues. Retention
of students who enter secondary education calls
for imaginative approaches to ensuring that
instructional material and curricula are relevant
and develop vocational skills in students.

those who joined should complete the course,
and that secondary school leavers should be
equipped with the technical and communication
skills necessary to join the world of work.

Access
In the year 2003-04, Karnataka had 9,012
high schools, representing a 10 per cent growth
since the last HDR (1999). Of these, 3,029 were
government, 2,621 were private aided and 3,362
were unaided institutions. Bangalore Urban
district (1,179) had the largest number of high
schools followed by Belgaum (636) and Tumkur
(593) (Appendix Tables: Series 4).

Given the dominance
of the private sector in
secondary education,
government schools
fortunately have a strong
presence in rural areas
where they can achieve
optimal impact in terms of
universal access.

Private, unaided schools grew very rapidly from
845 in 1990-91 to 3,362 in 2003-04. From
1998-99 to 2002-03, however, the rate of
growth of unaided schools was 20 per cent while
government and aided schools grew at 46 and
seven per cent respectively. About two-third of high
schools are located in south Karnataka whereas
only 57.3 per cent of the state’s population
resides in this region. This pattern is replicated
for all types of management. Gulbarga had the
highest number of government schools (251),
Belgaum the largest number of aided schools
(271) and Bangalore Urban had 841 unaided
schools. In fact, Bangalore Urban depends heavily
on the private sector to provide school education.
It also had a large number of private, aided
schools (235). Districts adjacent to Bangalore
Urban such as Tumkur, Kolar and Bangalore Rural,
and Belgaum and Bidar in north Karnataka also
had a significant number of unaided high schools.
In addition to Bangalore Urban district, Belgaum,
Bijapur, Bangalore Rural, Chitradurga, Dakshina
Kannada, Davangere,Tumkur and Uttara Kannada
had a heavy concentration of aided schools.

The distribution pattern of high schools does not
seem to be correlated with the socio-economic
needs of the student population. Given the
dominance of the private sector in secondary
education, government schools fortunately have
a strong presence in rural areas where they can
achieve optimal impact in terms of universal
access, while unaided schools are concentrated
in urban areas where incomes are higher and
parents are ready to pay for what is perceived
as ‘quality education’. ‘Quality’ is that highly
marketable commodity which is associated with
private schools, aided and unaided, though
unaided schools which do not have to conform
to certain government regulations are seen as
vastly superior by parents.The social awareness of
urban parents about the importance of education
in enhancing their wards’ life skills and enlarging
their choices leads them to demand quality in
education, and they are both willing and able to
pay for ‘quality’ education, which often means
education in English-medium schools.
The scenario is quite different among the poor,
who have to be persuaded into accepting the
value of education and be motivated to send
their children to school. The elite do not send their
wards to government schools because they lack
quality. Private schools typically provide better
infrastructure such as classrooms, laboratories,
libraries, and other resources such as sports
and extra-curricular activities, but at a price. In
terms of quality, government has highly qualified
teachers, but in terms of motivation and outcomes,
private schools often do better. This does result in
a scenario where the poor and marginal groups
have access to an education quite different from
that which the elite enjoy. The answer would be to
improve the quality of education in government
schools and hope that private schools will provide
scholarships to the academically gifted poor, as in
the West.

Enrolment
Enrolment in high schools increased from 5,57,735
in 1997-98 to 19,49,404 in 1999-2000 and was
19,51,313 in 2002-03. In the year 1997-98, the
percentage of girls was 43, which increased to
46.5 in 2003-04 (Table 5.16).

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

The gross enrolment ratio in secondary education
in classes I to X has improved from 84 in 1998-99
to 90 in 2000-01. There is a marked difference
between the GER of girls (87) and boys (93).
Across social groups, the GER of ST students is
lower than that of SCs and all communities.
A completely different picture emerges if one
examines the GER for classes XI and XII only. In
1998-99, the GER for the secondary stage was
47.9 and it increased to 52.1 in 2003-04. There
is not much difference between boys and girls.The
GER for these two classes is almost half of the
GER for classes I to X (Table 5.17). In 2000-01
and 2003-04, the GER of Raichur was the lowest
in respect of all children, girls and boys. Gulbarga
has the lowest GER for ST children in 2000-01.

Retention
There has been a decline in the dropout rate in
secondary education (classes I to X) over the
years. In 1992-93, the dropout rate in secondary

South Karnataka may have the highest percentage
of enrolled girls, but enrolment has grown more
rapidly in the Bombay and Hyderabad Karnataka
regions. There has been a truly impressive growth
in ST girls’ enrolment in Hyderabad Karnataka.
Overall, the proportion of enrolment among girls
from the Scheduled Tribes is higher than that of
Scheduled Castes and over the years, the enrolment
of ST girls has increased at a faster rate than that
of others. Hassan had the highest percentage of
enrolled girls and Koppal the lowest in 2003-04.
However, the enrolment among the SC and ST girls
in some districts is still a matter of concern; for
example, it is below 25 per cent and 29 per cent
in Koppal and Gulbarga districts respectively.
Significant gender differentials in enrolment exist
between rural and urban areas in some of the less
developed districts of north Karnataka, viz. Bijapur,
Bagalkot, Gulbarga, Bellary and Raichur (Seventh
All-India Education Survey, 2002, Provisional
Statistics). Government schools have the highest
number of enrolled girls, indicating that they either
fulfill the demands of equity or that parents are
less willing to incur the costs of private schooling
for daughters. However, the retention rate of girls
declines in the higher classes as they are pulled out
of school to get married or to stay at home.

59.61 per cent in 2003-04. Kodagu had the
lowest dropout rate and Bellary the highest in
1999-2000. In 2003-04, Kodagu and Tumkur
had the lowest dropout rates, i.e. below 23
per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Gulbarga

had the highest percentage of dropouts that year.

per cent (Kodagu) to a high 79 per cent in
Gulbarga in 2003-04. The overall dropout rate
is high in north Karnataka as only three districts
of this region are below the state average as
compared to eight districts of south Karnataka,
which are below the state average. Figure 5.9
depicts that even though the dropout ratio has
been declining since 1992-93 to 2003-04, it is
still quite high at around 60 per cent.

Appointment of teachers
Recruitment of teachers has kept pace with
enrolment, as the pupil–teacher ratio has
remained almost constant: merely changing
from 23 in 1997-98 to 25 in 2002-03. Bidar
has the highest PTR and Kodagu the lowest, but
the variation between regions is not significant.
The presence of women teachers, especially in
rural areas, actively enhances the enrolment and
retention of girls at the secondary level. Parents
hesitate to send teenagers to schools that are
staffed almost exclusively by men.The percentage
of female teachers in the state was 33.37
per cent in 1998-99, but fell to 32.33 per cent
in 2002-03. Bijapur had the lowest percentage
of female teachers (13.2) and Bangalore Urban
the highest (64.5) in 1998-99. By 2003-04
Gulbarga had the lowest percentage (10.16)
while Bangalore Urban still topped the list with
58.68 per cent female teachers. This highlights
an unfortunate trend which is confirmed by the
Seventh All-India Education Survey provisional
figures: the percentage of women teachers in
rural areas is almost half the number in urban
areas in almost all districts. Districts in the

The enrolment of girls
is lower than that of
boys and their dropout

inescapable reality is
that if girls continue with

School infrastructure
This is another variable that influences both
enrolment and retention, especially of girl students.
Drinking water and separate toilets for girls are
not always available in high school buildings. Only
32 per cent of the high schools in the state have
separate toilets for girls and only 46 per cent
have common toilets for boys and girls. Gadag
has the highest percentage of high schools with
toilets for girls and Chamarajnagar the lowest.
The absence of toilets for adolescent girls is rather
high in the state. Uttara Kannada, Gulbarga and
Chamarajnagar have the lowest infrastructure
index while Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and
Chikmaglur have the highest (Figure 5.10).

region, with low retention numbers for girls, are
also below the state average in terms of women
teachers (Table 5.18). This scenario does little
to whittle away at socio-cultural biases that
work for the attrition of girls in secondary
education. The gender biases that women
teachers experience in the work place also
encourage them to opt for the relative security
of urban areas. This is one Catch 22 situation to
which innovative solutions, such as residential
quarters for women teachers and residential
schools for girls, will have to be found.

of SC/ST students is also unsatisfactory, but
overall, girls in every social group usually outperform boys. As we saw, the enrolment of girls
is lower than that of boys and their dropout rate
is higher, but the inescapable reality is that if girls
continue with their education, then they perform
exceedingly well. Their high attrition rate from
class I to X signals wastage of human resources
on an unimaginable scale. This is a loss, both for
women as gender-class and for a nation where

Plus-two education

Gender

Since the focus of this chapter is school education,
we propose to dwell only briefly on the next levels
of education. ‘Plus-two’, or ‘pre-university’ (PU)
education, in Karnataka is conducted in both high
schools and pre-university colleges. Conceptually, it
is a bridge leading from high school to professional
courses in medicine, engineering, agriculture et. al.
or to general education. A student who passes high
school should ideally decide at this point whether
he or she wants to pursue vocational education in
polytechnics, industrial training institutes or at the
plus-two stage itself in pre-university courses, or
move on to tertiary education.

The ratio of PU colleges increased from 3.9
per one lakh population in 1998 to 4.4 in
2003-04. Overall, PU colleges are unevenly
distributed across the state, with southern
Karnataka having the highest number of PU
colleges and Hyderabad Karnataka the least.
In 2003-04, eight districts in north Karnataka
and four districts in south Karnataka were
below the state average. The enrolment in PU
colleges has increased at a faster rate than for
all other institutions.

The performance of students in PU examinations
shows that there has been significant
improvement in pass percentages in the state,
from 48 per cent in 1997-98 to 58 per cent in
2003-04. Girls have done better than boys in all
districts. While this is heartening, it also leads to
some uncomfortable questions about attrition at
the next level, i.e. enrolment in tertiary education
where girls are under-represented. Across
districts, Dakshina Kannada tops the list while

A student can pick vocational courses from a
variety of institutions: polytechnics, industrial
training institutes (ITIs) and vocational courses
at the PU level itself. The objective here is to
reduce the pressure on higher education, but
more important, to impart vocational skills to
prepare students for self-employment. About
182 polytechnics (38 government, 36 aided and
108 private institutions) offer diploma courses
in various engineering disciplines, fashion
technology, commercial practice, cinematography,
etc. About 70,000 students are enrolled in these
courses. The department of Vocational Education
runs 890 courses as diverse and disparate as
dairying, accountancy, garment design, civil
construction and computer technology to name a
few. There were 68 government and 328 private
ITIs in the state in 1998-99, which increased to
104 and 466 by 2003-04, showing a growth rate
of 8.9 per cent and 7.3 per cent per annum for
government and private ITIs respectively.
The spread of government polytechnics varies
from a low 11 per cent in Bombay Karnataka to
a high 28 per cent each in southern Karnataka
and Hyderabad Karnataka. The southern districts
have the highest proportion of private unaided
institutions (61.67) in 2002-03. The dominance
of private institutions, particularly in the backward
areas of the state, is likely to create inequalities,
as only the higher income groups can afford
them. The predominance of the private sector is
again apparent when we look at the ITI stream
of vocational training. In 2003-04, Belgaum
district had the highest number of government
institutions and Koppal had the lowest number of
private ITIs, while south Karnataka has a better
distribution of institutions than north Karnataka.
The enrolment in ITIs increased at a compound

during the same period. Girls constitute only 16.6

than in north Karnataka (2003-04). The lowest
proportion of girls’ enrolment was in Koppal
district (0.95) while Chitradurga (50.2) had the
highest. Disturbingly, girls’ enrolment in ITIs is
very low in the less developed districts.
Vocational education institutions, both government
and private, show a sharp decline over the period
1998-99 to 2003-04. The decline in private
institutions (3.63 per cent) is more marked than in
government institutions (0.68) but there has been

How relevant and useful are these courses and to
what extent do they succeed in providing viable
alternatives to tertiary education courses? The
Task Force on Higher Education (2004) reports
that annually, only 59 per cent of the intake in
polytechnics is utilised, showing severe wastage.
Ultimately, these courses will find takers only
if they lead to employment and enhanced
incomes.

An education index of districts (EI) has been
computed based on the literacy rate and the
GER. Despite significant improvement in the EI
of Raichur in 1991-2001, the relative status of
this district has not changed. In 1991, Raichur
district occupied the lowest position and
Dakshina Kannada ranked first among districts.
In 2001, Raichur occupied the lowest place for
all communities and Scheduled Castes, while
Gulbarga district is last in the EI for Scheduled
Tribes. Bangalore Urban, Kodagu, Dakshina
Kannada and Udupi are well above the state
average while Raichur, Gulbarga, Koppal, Bellary
and Chamarajnagar are below the state average
(Table 5.20).

There is a need to evaluate these courses and
ascertain how many students actually get the
jobs/vocations for which they study. Vocational
education is a complex area, since changes in
the job market/business scenario can impact
the courses that are being offered. Institutions
have to be dynamic and have the flexibility to
add new options/courses, e.g. repair of mobile
phones, computers and eliminate courses that
are no longer relevant to the market. Government
institutions too need to operate under a framework
that allows for such flexibility. Private institutions
may be slightly better placed in this respect, but
both government and private institutions have
the same boards, which dictate course content
and which are slow to respond to new market
demands.

literacy by 50 per cent by 2007 seems
over-ambitious since, between 1991 and
2001, the gender gap in literacy dwindled
by only 3.1 and 3.76 percentage points
in the rural and urban areas respectively.
The illiteracy rate is more than 63 per cent
among Scheduled Tribes and about 58 per
cent among Scheduled Caste females.
The literacy level of SCs in Karnataka was
higher than the all-India SC literacy level
with reference to both female and total
literacy in 1991. In 2001, the SC literacy
rate was lower than the all-India SC male,
female and all, which is a matter of great
concern.
As many as 15 districts (9 in north and 6 in
south Karnataka) have a literacy rate that is
below the state average, while five districts of
the Hyderabad Karnataka region are below
the all-India literacy rate in respect of total,
male and female literacy levels.
North Karnataka, especially Hyderabad
Karnataka, performs poorly in several
indicators. Enrolment rates have risen in
primary education in the state particularly in
Raichur district, but unfortunately the GER of
this district has been the lowest in the state
from 1996-97 to 2000-01 meaning that
all districts are working towards improving
enrolment and retention and Raichur will
need special attention to match them. The
highest dropout rate for girls is in Gulbarga
(58 per cent) and Bellary (55.40 per cent) in
2003-04 in classes I to VII. Retention is thus
a crucial challenge.
The mean years of schooling have increased
only slightly from 3.97 in 1999-2000 to
4.25 in 2003-04.
Significant work remains to be done to
enhance the quality of teaching-learning.
The ‘no detention’ policy, while encouraging

retention of children upto class V, could also
lead to an inadequate assessment of learning
and teaching in the first four years (which are,
admittedly, the most significant years as far
as learning is concerned). Further, measures
to assess learning are still largely dominated
by test-of-memory examinations.
About three per cent primary schools in rural,
and four per cent schools in urban areas, do
not have any teachers at all while slightly more
than 20 per cent in rural and seven per cent
schools in urban areas have only one teacher.
Nine districts in north Karnataka and five
districts in south Karnataka have less than 50
per cent female teachers in primary schools
in 2003-04.
Primary school infrastructure is a critical
variable for retention. However, as many as
nine out of 12 districts of north Karnataka
are below the state infrastructure index
average. DPEP districts should have basic
infrastructure as it was one of the objectives
of DPEP, but it seems this has been only
partially fulfilled with 6 out of 11 (DPEP)
districts still below the state average. As many
as seven districts in southern Karnataka are
below the infrastructure index average.
The dropout rate at the secondary level is
about 60 per cent by the time students reach
class X.The low percentage of female teachers
and lack of infrastructure are contributory
factors to the high dropout rate of girls.
The infrastructure of high schools is relatively
poor, particularly in north Karnataka, as
the average index (0.37) of these districts
is below the average index of the state
(0.42). In 2002-03, 54 per cent of schools
did not have any toilets and 68 per cent of
schools did not have separate toilets for
girls.
Examination results indicate that government
and rural high schools do not perform as well
as privately managed schools and urban
schools. With government schools catering
to low socio-economic groups, girls, SCs
and STs and rural areas, this is a matter of
concern.

Literacy and Education

Karnataka has dealt
satisfactorily with the
access and enrolment
goals. Retention and
quality of learning are
more complex and
challenging goals, since
they need varied and
qualitative strategies
while the first two
– access and enrolment
– largely need physical/
quantitative remedies.

join should complete secondary education’
is yet to be achieved as only 40 per cent
of those who joined completed secondary
education in the state in 2003-04.
The increasing popularity of private schools
can be a cause for concern from an equity
perspective. This preference for private
(unaided) schools is most visible in urban
areas, where parents seem to prefer them
to government schools, wherever they can
afford them.
Currently, vocational education lacks the
mechanisms for responding quickly to
changing market demands. Certain courses
are under-subscribed in polytechnics and
many courses have shut down in the
department of Vocational Education.
Vocational courses have become stopovers for
tertiary education instead of being terminal
points.

Recommendations
While the state has
achieved its target of 50
per cent women teachers,
their over-concentration in
urban areas will have to
be corrected.

The quality of
decision-making in the
administration would be
significantly enhanced if
an EMIS was available at
state, district, taluk and
village levels.

While literacy rates in urban Karnataka are very
good, the literacy levels of the rural population,
women, SCs and STs, and more particularly SC
and ST women indicate that the state is far from
reaching theTenth Plan goals. Literacy levels in the
northeastern districts are considerably below the
state and national averages.The hiatus in national
spending and targeting of low-performing areas
and groups must give way to a renewed focus on
adult education.
The goals of access, enrolment, retention, are in
a way sequential, in the sense that each goal
needs to be significantly achieved before the next
can be meaningfully addressed. Karnataka has
dealt satisfactorily with the access and enrolment
goals. Retention and quality of learning are more
complex and challenging goals, since they need
varied and qualitative strategies while the first two
— access and enrolment — largely need physical/
quantitative remedies. Physical/quantitative goals
are easier to achieve than qualitative/soft goals.
Most vulnerable to dropping out of school are girls
from all social classes, the poor and the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes. Geographically, the northern
districts and especially the Hyderabad Karnataka
region have poor education indicators. Focused

targeting of these marginal sub-populations thus
becomes necessary.
Infrastructure facilities, particularly classrooms,
separate toilets for girls and drinking water
should be provided to all schools on a priority
basis. Lack of these facilities could negatively
impact retention, especially of girls. Though toilets
have been constructed in many schools, they have
become unworkable without water supply. Hence,
construction of toilets must go hand in hand with
providing water facilities. In addition, upgradation
of laboratories and libraries in high schools should
be taken up.
The proportion of female teachers in rural schools
is about half of that in urban schools with a few
exceptions in some south Karnataka districts.
Thus, while the state has achieved its target of 50
per cent women teachers, their over-concentration
in urban areas will have to be corrected to ensure
that rural primary schools do not suffer from a
shortage of women teachers.
From a governance perspective, there will have
to be concerted efforts to ensure that teachers
do not absent themselves from school, even
for authorised purposes. In a single teacher or
multi-grade school, this means that the school
effectively closes down. Good governance is
the critical factor here in curbing indiscipline,
whether it is in ensuring that schools in remote,
underserved areas get teachers and these
teachers actually report for work or in curbing
absenteeism and encouraging committed
teachers to perform well.
The quality of decision-making in the
administration would be significantly enhanced
if an EMIS (Education Management Information
System) was available to administration at the
state, district, taluk and village levels. For instance,
information on the current status of teacher
vacancies and absenteeism, training and training
needs would help administrators significantly.
Panchayat Raj institutions (PRI) and community
support to schools for fully achieving the goals
of education can be split into two categories

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

– ‘hard’ factors such as infrastructure, enrolment,
attendance and ‘soft’ factors such as quality of
teaching-learning. Gram panchayats and School
Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs)
will have to play an important role in infrastructure
creation and supporting enrolment and attendance
of both teachers and students, while department
officers provide academic/pedagogic input.

by recruiting more women high school teachers
as in primary levels, providing schools with basic
infrastructure (68 per cent of high schools do not
have separate toilets for girls) and by building
awareness in the community. Otherwise, girls
who constitute a high percentage of dropouts are
likely to lose out even more when the influx to
secondary education begins.

Village level tracking systems must be put in place
to monitor dropouts and out-of-school children. It
would mean that panchayat institutions, community
based organisations like the SDMC and departments,
viz. Education, Labour and Rural Development,
must organise a platform of interventions to ensure
that children enroll and stay on in school.

The infrastructure of high schools is poor, especially
in the northern districts. A high 54 per cent of
the schools do not have any toilet whatsoever.
Laboratories are so ill-equipped that Science
practicals are not conducted in the S.S.L.C.
examinations to ensure against urban bias. Many
high schools do not even have furniture for class
rooms. Hence these facilities will have to be
provided.

School adoption is a programme that should be
more fully explored. The department should make
the ‘School Adoption Programme’ easily accessible
to individuals and institutions all over the country,
and to NRIs in particular. The Internet can be a
relevant medium to promote this programme
world wide. School adoption could focus on the
infrastructure needs of the school.
In secondary education, government must take
steps now itself to accommodate the large stream
of students who will seek admission to high schools
in the wake of its successful implementation of the
Sarva Shikshan Abhiyan programme.
The tremendous attrition in secondary education
is due in part to lack of proper evaluation at the
primary level that lets most students pass through
the system, sometimes without having attained
minimum levels of learning. Bridge courses for
such children would ensure that they do not drop
out. The dropout rate at the secondary level is
about 60 per cent by the time students reach class
X. The low percentage of female teachers, lack of
infrastructure, especially separate toilets for girls,
and above all, social restrictions on girls once they
attain puberty, are contributory factors. This is a
difficult challenge that needs to be effectively
tackled to ensure that the benefits of education
reach girls. The education of girls is known to
have immense emancipatory and empowerment
potential, hence this must be accorded high priority

The tenth class has been conceptualised as a
terminal point for those who wish to discontinue
studies to enter the world of work. However, the
vocation/job opportunities for those who complete
secondary education is limited. This is another
complex area that needs attention. Students who
leave the education stream after completing class
X do not have sufficient skills, vocational and
communicative, to take up meaningful jobs. All too
often, they become alienated from their traditional
occupations such as agriculture. Incorporating
a vocational base to secondary education has
been tried several times and failed for various
reasons such as lack of relevance to market needs,
inflexibility of curricula and lack of trained teachers.
However, this is one area, which needs to be readdressed from a fresh perspective.
Vocational education has had its successes when
it has responded to the market, as in the case
of IT-based diplomas or Commercial Practice,
which is popular with girls as they get jobs almost
immediately. The older vocations such as civil and
mechanical engineering have seen a decline in
demand: these courses should be revamped, and
retraining teachers should go hand-in-hand with
this strategy. Developing vocational courses for
dropouts from the school system also needs to be
prioritised.

Village tracking systems
must be put in place to
monitor dropouts and
out-of-school children.

The education of girls is
known to have immense
emancipatory and
empowerment potential,
hence this must be
accorded high priority.
