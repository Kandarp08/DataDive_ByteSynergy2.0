Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation
Introduction
Shelter is a basic need for human existence – for
protection from the elements as well as to raise
families. And, just as provision of shelter facilitates
human existence, access to drinking water,
sanitation and hygiene rank foremost among the
basic services that affect human development.
Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation
impacts not only poverty and health indicators,
but also has critical gender implications in terms
of women’s work and women’s health. This
chapter deals with these three facets of human
development in Karnataka.

I. HOUSING
While all human beings need shelter, for the poor,
even the most basic shelter may be beyond reach
because they do not own land or because the
cost of building materials and construction is too
high. Shelter is a basic human need. The National
Housing and Habitat Policy, 1998 provides the
framework for the implementation of shelter
programmes in the country. The national agenda
on housing envisages the creation of 2 million
houses every year. The Habitat policy and the
national agenda recognise housing activity as an
engine for substantial employment generation in
the country.

The ‘Working Group on Housing’ for the preparation
of the ‘Tenth Plan Approach Paper’ has observed
that 90 per cent of the housing shortage relates
to the poor and that there is need to increase the
supply of affordable housing to low income groups
through a proper process of allocation of land,
extension of funding assistance and provision of
support services. All the issues identified by the
Working Group relate to the sphere of activity
and responsibility of state governments and local
bodies, and therefore, the success of the National
Housing Policy depends largely on the efforts of
state governments.
Providing better living conditions for people is now
a global concern. The Millennium Development
Goals envisage achieving significant improvements
in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers
by the year 2020. In this context, urban planning
and governance structures have to be made more
effective, and incorporate an explicitly pro-poor
focus on land rights and affordable low-cost
housing to meet the burgeoning demand for
shelter in urban areas.

While all human beings
need shelter, for the
poor, even the most basic
shelter may be beyond
reach because they do not
own land or because the
cost of building materials
and construction is too
high.

The housing scenario
In Karnataka, 54.9 per cent of households live in
permanent houses, as compared with Kerala, which

has the highest percentage of households (68.1
per cent) living in permanent houses among the
southern states.This is above the national average
of 51.8 per cent. A high 35.6 per cent of households
in Karnataka have semi-permanent houses, a
high proportion among southern states, and
above the national average of 30 per cent. Urban
households perform better, with 77.9 per cent
households living in permanent houses, as
compared with only 42.6 per cent in rural areas.
The scenario is reversed with regard to temporary
houses. (Table 7.1)
Karnataka (78.5 per cent) stands fourth among
the southern states with regard to the number of
households living in houses that they own. This is
less than the national average of 86.66 per cent.
Karnataka, with 18.7 per cent households living
in rented houses, ranks just after Tamil Nadu (19.9

Karnataka’s Habitat Policy
The state’s millennium policy envisages:
1. Construction of 2,00,000 houses each year and 10,00,000 houses during the period
2000-05 through state government sponsored Ashraya and Ambedkar (the latter scheme
is for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) housing programmes as well as Centrally
sponsored housing programmes for the poor;
2. Preparation of a reliable database for implementing housing programmes for the poor in
rural and urban areas;
3. Ownership of the dwelling units shall be in the name of women except in the case of
widowers, ex-servicemen, and the physically disabled;
4. Quotas for the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in allocation - in 2002-03, the quotas
increased to 40 per cent for SCs from 30 per cent and for STs to 10 per cent from three
per cent;
5. Quotas for the physically disabled were enhanced from three per cent to five per cent in
2003 and for senior citizens without any income, it is two per cent;
6. Establishing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Housing Corporation
as the nodal agency to implement the housing programmes;
7. Providing a subsidy at Rs.10,000 per unit to all (poor) beneficiaries and an additional
subsidy of Rs.10,000 for SCs/STs for houses constructed in rural areas;
8. Procuring, preferably by direct purchase from landowners, lands required for housing in
rural and urban areas;
9. Providing house sites free of cost to eligible beneficiaries in both rural and urban areas;
10. Encouraging beneficiary participation in construction;
11. Providing guarantee for funds borrowed from HUDCO and other financial institutions;
12. Facilitating housing for certain socio-economic groups such as beedi workers, porters in
agricultural market yards, weavers, artisans, leather artisans, safai karmacharis, fisher
people; and
13. Beneficiary selection through gram sabhas.

per cent) among the southern states. However, the
proportion of households owning houses in rural
areas is quite high at 91.2 per cent (Table 7.1).
Across districts, only 24 per cent households in
Raichur district live in permanent houses and
44.3 per cent are in semi-permanent houses, as
compared with Bangalore Urban district, where
89.7 per cent households live in permanent
houses. The proportion of temporary houses is the
highest in Koppal district (33.8 per cent) followed
by Raichur (31.7 per cent), Gadag (28.1 per cent)
and Bellary (24.5 per cent), all of which are in
north Karnataka (Appendix Tables: Series 9).
Bangalore Urban district tops the state in respect
of households living in permanent houses in urban
areas (92.1 per cent) while Bidar (a low HDI district)
tops the state in respect rural households living in
permanent houses (74.5 per cent). Raichur has
the lowest percentage of rural households living in
permanent houses (13.7 per cent) and Gadag has
the lowest percentage of urban households (41.3
per cent) living in permanent houses. Data indicates
that Bangalore Urban has the least percentage of
semi-permanent houses (6.4) in respect of urban
areas (Appendix Tables: Series 9).
Data on the tenure of households indicates that
the lowest percentage of families (45.69) that
own houses are to be found in Bangalore Urban,
which is below the state average of 78.46 per cent.
The highest percentage of households in
Bangalore Urban lived in rented houses (50.73).
The highest percentage (90.94) of households
that own houses is in Chamarajnagar (a low HDI
district) followed by Udupi (90.42) and Bidar
(90.19). In Udupi, a high HDI district, we find only
7.37 per cent of households in rented houses. A
low 68.3 per cent of rural households in Kodagu
district own their houses, followed by Bangalore
Urban (69.0 per cent) while 95.7 per cent of rural
households who own houses are situated in a
relatively underdeveloped district like Bidar. The
urban scenario shows that in Bangalore Urban,
only 43 per cent households own houses while 54
per cent live in rented houses (Appendix Tables:
Series 9).

Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation

There appears to be little correlation between the
economic development of a district and house
ownership patterns. House ownership is high in the
predominantly agrarian north Karnataka districts
where land values are less likely to be affected
by speculation consequent on urbanisation as in
Bangalore Urban. Migration to cities is a factor
that pushes up the percentage of persons living
in rented houses.

House ownership is high
in the predominantly
agrarian north Karnataka
districts where land
values are less likely

Bangalore Urban.

Policy interventions
Given the relatively low percentage of house
ownership in the state, Karnataka has long
recognised the significance of housing as an
important component of the Minimum Needs
Programme. Indeed, Karnataka had launched a
state-funded housing programme for the poor
through the Ashraya and Ambedkar housing
programmes in 1993-94, long before the National
Habitat Policy was formulated. The state has one
of the best housing programmes in the country.

Housing schemes
The Ashraya programme provides assistance of
Rs.20,000 of which Rs.10,000 is a subsidy and
the remaining Rs.10,000 is a loan. For SC/ST
beneficiaries in both Ashraya and Ambedkar
programmes, the entire provision of Rs.20,000
is a subsidy. In the urban Ashraya programme,
the assistance is Rs.25,000 with a beneficiary
contribution of at least Rs.5,000.
The state launched the ambitious ‘One Million
Housing Programme’ in October 2000, which
envisaged the construction of one million dwelling
units in rural and urban areas during the period
2000-05, i.e. 2,00,000 houses each year. Rural
housing has been given primacy with an annual
target of about 1,70,000-2,20,000 houses.
The annual target for the urban programme is
30,000. The cost of urban projects is usually very
high.

BOX 7.2

Some innovative strategies
 Beneficiary participation

Local bodies and SPVs have traditionally constructed housing projects with
little input from beneficiaries. Over the last five years, however, beneficiary
construction has become the preferred mode of implementation, particularly
in the districts of south Karnataka. This mode of construction is facilitated
by the presence of reasonably skilled construction labour such as masons
and underemployed farm labour, which doubles as semi-skilled or unskilled
construction labour. At present, about 80 per cent of the construction of
houses for the economically weaker sections (EWS) in rural areas is
constructed by beneficiaries.This has the advantage of ensuring that dwelling
units address the social, cultural and occupational needs of the beneficiaries
far more effectively than agency-constructed core housing could hope to
achieve. Beneficiary participation takes the form of direct participation
in construction, supervision of work, attending to simple, yet significant,
tasks such as curing cement blocks or masonry to provide additional funds
for construction of the dwelling unit. The generation of local employment
and use of locally available building materials is a crucial economic
outcome of this approach. There is better accountability for the funds since
these are made available to the beneficiaries only when they attain the
prescribed benchmarks. ‘Self-help’ housing does not, however, mean that
beneficiaries are deprived of technical inputs. Taluk panchayat engineering
staff, Nirmithi Kendras and the Karnataka Land Army Corporation (KLAC)
provide construction support to beneficiaries who are unable to construct
their own houses. In urban areas, ‘core’ housing is provided by agencies

158

as a matter of policy to prevent speculation in land, since land markets are
poorly organised and there is heavy demand for house sites, even by the
non-poor and there is every likelihood that sites may be sold to speculators,
thus defeating the purpose of the programme.
 Women’s empowerment

The decision of the state to select only women beneficiaries for assistance
under the housing programmes (barring some exceptions) and give hakku
patras (title deeds) for house sites and houses only in the names of the
women of the household, has had a critical impact on ownership patterns in
a society where land, houses and assets traditionally belong to men. It is a
significant step towards promoting gender equity.
 Community participation

The selection of beneficiaries was initially entrusted to the Ashraya
Committee. Now gram panchayats identify and select beneficiaries,
and the very poor will hopefully now be in a position to articulate their
demands.This is a significant step towards governance through community
participation.
 Social equity

There is specific targeting of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe people
through the Ambedkar (100.0 per cent) and Ashraya programmes
(50.0 per cent).

A village-wise demand survey was conducted by
gram panchayats during May-June 2003 and it
has been estimated that there are 12.26 lakh
houseless people and 10.43 lakh people without
house sites who have asked for assistance under
the programme. Since 2001-02, a large number
of new village settlements known as Navagramas
has been created adjoining, and preferably
abutting existing village settlements to decongest
villages. So far 2,399 Navagramas have been
created to provide better amenities.
Table 7.2 gives details of houses constructed
under the state and Central government sponsored
housing programmes during 1999-2004. State
sponsored schemes constitute 80 per cent of the
rural housing programmes and 87.5 per cent of
the urban housing programmes implemented in
Karnataka.The state had invested over Rs.18,912
million till March 2004 to create 8,96,269
dwelling units.

Recommendations


It would be no exaggeration to state that the
poor find it difficult to borrow for housing.



Commercial banks are unwilling to lend to
the poor, and even if they are willing to do
so, lending norms, guidelines and collateral
security requirements mean that the most
needy get excluded. Hence, in Karnataka,
institutional lending is channelled through
the state government.The concerns of banks
can be met by organising an institutional
partnership with local bodies and
microfinance structures that would ensure
loan recoveries cost-effectively and also
facilitate savings for home loans to meet
credibility requirements. There is definitely
a need for banks to have a fresh look at the
lending norms for the poor to enable them
to access funds for housing.
Currently, provision of infrastructure facilities
like water, electricity, sanitation, internal
roads and drains is not being financed under
any housing programme. This has resulted in
poor occupancy and a poor quality of life for
occupants in the settlements. Infrastructure
provision is extremely resource intensive and
should not be left to cash-starved local bodies
to provide; it should be funded by the state

since the ability of the poor to contribute is

In Karnataka the state survey reveals that
14.31 lakh families are houseless and
15.08 lakh families do not own house sites.
The number of houseless families is the
highest in Belgaum (1.07 lakh) followed
by Gulbarga (1.02 lakh), Kolar (0.99 lakh),
Mysore (0.96 lakh) and Tumkur (0.94).1
Public policy must focus on targeting
resources to districts where the problem of
houselessness is most acute.
An evaluation-cum-audit of the gender
sensitive initiative that mandates that house
title deeds shall be in women’s names must
be taken up to assess the impact of this step
in changing gender relations and empowering
women.
The National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM)
is expected to be the major vehicle for urban
renewal in the country, providing substantial
financial assistance for urban infrastructure
and provision of basic services for the urban
poor. Accordingly, the city development
plans and strategies must focus on enabling
the poor to better access civic services.
Those working in the urban informal sector,
especially women, must be included in the
agenda for urban regeneration.

II. DRINKING WATER AND
SANITATION
Among the basic services that affect human
development are access to drinking water (defined
in terms of availability, proximity and quality),
sanitation and hygiene. Access to drinking water
has implications not only for health status and
human development parameters but also for
opportunities depending upon the opportunity cost
of time. This has special implications for women
and children. The responsibility for fetching water,
sometimes over long distances, for household
needs is invariably assigned to women or girls,
who drop out of school to attend to these chores.
Hence, the ready availability of safe drinking water
lays the foundation for improvement in literacy
and health indicators in communities.
According to the 2001 Census estimates, 31.7
per cent of all households in Karnataka had access
to drinking water within their premises, 46.4
per cent outside the premises, and a substantially
lower number (21.8 per cent) had access away
from the premises.2 Disaggregated data shows
that urban Karnataka is doing better in terms of
facilities; in rural Karnataka, only 18.5 per cent of
households had access to drinking water within
the premises compared with a high 56.5 per cent
for urban Karnataka. However, the statistics
are reversed with regard to access to drinking
water outside the premises, with 55.4 per cent
rural households having access to drinking water
outside the premises as against 29.6 per cent for
urban areas. This unequal pattern continues with
reference to the percentage of households with
access to drinking water away from the premises:
it is 26.1 per cent for rural Karnataka and 13.8
per cent for urban Karnataka (Table 7.3).
However, this pattern holds good for other states
as well: countrywide, access to drinking water
is markedly better in urban areas than in rural
areas. The principal sources of drinking water are
taps, hand pumps, tube wells, wells, tanks, ponds,

lakes, rivers, canals and springs, etc. Forty-eight
per cent rural households and 78.4 per cent urban
households access their drinking water from

households rely on hand pumps and 15.6 per cent
on wells while in urban areas; taps constitute the
dominant source (Table 7.4).
Some important indicators available for sanitation
relate to access to bathroom and latrine facilities.
Here, too, the rural–urban difference is marked.
While 79.1 per cent urban households had a
bathroom in the premises, the proportion for rural
areas was 48.1 per cent. While a high 82.5 per cent
of rural households had no latrines in the premises,
only 24.7 per cent urban households did not
have latrines. As many as 44.9 per cent urban
households had water closets. Both urban and rural
households were relatively on a par when it came
to drain connectivity for waste water (rural: 31.1
per cent; urban: 39.3 per cent), the real difference
lies in the fact that 64.6 per cent rural households,
by and large, did not have any kind of drainage
connectivity whereas only 19 per cent urban
dwellers lacked this facility (Table 7.5).

Since the beginning of the 1980s, bore-wells
have been the main basis of water supply
schemes in the state.The policy of the government
is to provide bore-wells with hand pumps to
habitations with a population of less than 500,
mini water supply schemes to habitations with a
population between 500 and 1,000, and piped
water supply schemes to habitations with a
population of more than 1,000. In the last few
years, the groundwater level is being depleted
very quickly in most districts, resulting in a large
number of bore-wells drying up. Strategically,
drilling new bore-wells is now seen to be less
efficient than deepening existing bore-wells to
improve water yields. Surface water sources

Rural drinking water
Karnataka has been giving high priority to rural
drinking water over the last two decades. While
the national norm stipulates provision of 40 litres
per capita per day (lpcd) of safe drinking water
within 500 metres of the place of residence,
Karnataka has set a target of 55 lpcd.

schemes and 17,170 piped water schemes
(Annual Report 2004-05: Rural Development
and Panchayat Raj Department). Accordingly,
the percentage of households with access to
safe drinking water has increased from 67.3
per cent in 1991 to 96.08 per cent in 2001
and to 99.0 per cent in 2004. The water supply
service level in terms of litres per capita per day
(lpcd) has also improved since 1991. There were
20,398 habitations with 40 lpcd and above
in 1991, 38,701 habitations in 1999 and in
2004 as many as 41,115 habitations had water
availability of 40 lpcd and above.

Access
Accessibility of drinking water improved to over 80
per cent in all districts in 2001. In rural Karnataka,
18.5 per cent households had access to drinking
water within the premises, as compared with 12.0
per cent in Tamil Nadu, 22.7 per cent in Andhra
Pradesh, 38.9 per cent in Maharashtra and 69.1
per cent in Kerala. Except Kerala, most states,
including Karnataka, have been able to provide
drinking water outside the premises (Table 7.6).
However, a high 26.1 per cent of rural households
in the state access drinking water away from their
premises. Karnataka is close to Andhra Pradesh’s
21.9 per cent in this respect. There are still some
habitations where drought conditions lead to
water being transported in tankers or by train.
Continuous drought conditions from 2001-02 to
2003-04 led to water being transported to about
500 villages in the state. Almost 48.5 per cent of
rural households access their drinking water from
taps compared with 60.5 per cent in Tamil Nadu.
Rural areas primarily rely on hand pumps and
wells while taps constitute the dominant source in
urban areas (Table 7.7).
Among districts, Udupi (56.0 per cent), Dakshina
Kannada (54.0 per cent) and Uttara Kannada
(42.0 per cent) have the highest percentage of
rural households with access to drinking water
within the premises. Raichur (9.0 per cent),
Gulbarga and Bijapur (10.0 per cent) all in
north Karnataka have the lowest percentage of
rural households with access to drinking water
within the premises. Districts with the highest
percentage of rural households with access to

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

drinking water away from the premises are
Raichur (43.0), Gulbarga (41.0) and Bijapur
(36.0). Districts with the lowest percentage of
rural households with access to drinking water
away from the premises are Mandya (14.0), and
Dakshina Kannada (15.0).The arid, water-starved
districts of north Karnataka have problems of
access and sustainability while the coastal and
malnad districts perform better in terms of access
(Appendix Tables: Series 9).
The data on the distribution of households by
location of drinking water reveals that some
districts are heavily dependant on wells, viz.
Udupi (80.0), Dakshina Kannada (70.0) and
Uttara Kannada (65.0) while Chamarajnagar
(46.0), Bijapur (42.0), and, to a lesser extent,
Tumkur (36.0) are primarily dependant on hand
pumps. The remaining districts derive drinking
water principally from taps (Appendix Tables:
Series 9).

Quality
There are over 21,008 habitations with major
quality issues: excess fluoride: 5838; brackishness:
4460; nitrate: 4077 and iron: 6633. The water
in these villages is contaminated with fluoride
(>1.5 mg/litre), total dissolved salts (>1500
mg/litre), nitrate (>100 mg/litre) and/or iron
(1mg/litre). Under the Rajiv Gandhi National
Drinking Water Mission, there is a sub-mission to
deal with the problem of contaminated water. So
far 47 projects have been implemented, covering
628 fluoride affected habitations. Defluoridisation
plants have been set up in 200 villages. Individual
household filters are also being supplied at a
subsidised cost in fluoride affected villages.
Ingestion of fluoride contaminated water causes
fluorosis which causes staining and pitting of
the teeth and, in more severe cases, skeletal
abnormalities, leading to physical disability and
weakness, a consequent fall in labour productivity
and a decline in income levels.

Sustainability
The sustainability of water supply schemes is
a major concern of the government. Over 95
per cent of rural water supply schemes depend
on ground water sources. Over-exploitation of

Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation

Over-exploitation of
groundwater for irrigation
has led to a progressive
decline in the water table
and drying up of aquifers.

groundwater for irrigation has led to a progressive
decline in the water table and drying up of
aquifers. This has rendered many water supply
schemes non-functional. While efforts are being
made to rejuvenate these schemes by taking
recourse to deepening and hydro fracturing
bore-wells, a more sustainable strategy is the
recharging of groundwater through watershed
development. This strategy has been adopted in
the implementation of the Drought Prone Area
Development Programme, Desert Development
Programme, Integrated Wasteland Development
Programme, Western Ghat Development
Programme, etc. This has helped to recharge
groundwater in these areas.

Rural sanitation
Compared to the progress in rural water supply
in Karnataka, the progress in rural sanitation has
not been very satisfactory. While there has been a
sustained attempt to improve the provisioning of
safe drinking water since the 1980s, no such parallel
effort or investment was evident in rural sanitation.
It was only in the 1990s that this area became
the focus of policy interventions with the launch
of special schemes to provide toilets and sanitary
facilities in villages, viz. Nirmala Grama and Swasthi
Grama. Another programme, Swachcha Grama,
was launched in 2001 with an integrated focus
aimed at providing five facilities: (i) paving internal
roads and streets in the village; (ii) construction
of efficient sullage and storm water drainage; (iii)
providing community compost yards and removal of
manure pits from the dwelling areas of the village;
(iv) providing smokeless chulahs for all households;
and (v) construction of household, community and
school latrines in all villages. That these schemes
still have to make an impact is clear from the data
from the 2001 Census. A high 82.5 per cent of
rural households had no latrine in the house but
this is more or less on par with other neighbouring
states except Kerala (18.7 per cent only). The
percentage of rural households with bathrooms is
48.1 per cent, which is higher than Maharashtra
(46.1 per cent), Tamil Nadu (21.0 per cent)
and Andhra Pradesh (27.1 per cent) except Kerala
(56.5 per cent). Admittedly, 64.6 per cent of rural
households had no drainage connectivity for the
wastewater outlet, but this was still better than

164

Gujarat (86.3 per cent), Kerala (84.0 per cent)
and Tamil Nadu (72.6 per cent) (Table 7.8). Lack
of drainage facilities and toilets results in a highly
unsanitary environment, which is a precursor to
high morbidity rates.
District-wise data reveals that Udupi has the best
coverage of latrines (49.9 per cent) followed by
Kodagu (48.5 per cent), Dakshina Kannada (47.2
per cent) and Bangalore Urban (41.0 per cent). A
high 96.7 per cent of rural households in Bijapur
do not have latrines, followed by Gulbarga (94.9
per cent) and Bagalkot (94.6 per cent) (Appendix
Tables: Series 9).

Urban water supply and
sanitation
Urbanisation
The urban population in Karnataka has grown
from 16,40,000 in 1901 to 1,79,10,000 in
2001. The proportion of urban population to total
population of Karnataka is 33.98 per cent, higher
than the average for the country, which is 27.78
per cent. The state accounts for 6.28 per cent
of the country’s urban population, lower than
Maharashtra’s 14.37 per cent and Uttar Pradesh’s
12.09 per cent. Among the 27 districts of the
state, Bangalore Urban district has the highest
concentration of urban population, with almost
88.08 per cent of the district population residing
in urban areas. The district accounts for over 32
per cent of the urban population of the state. The
next highest concentration of urban population is
in Dharwad district (4.92 per cent) while Kodagu
district has only 0.42 per cent of urban population,
the lowest among all districts in the state. Haveri
district has seen the highest decadal growth rate
of urban population of 46.69 per cent between
1991 and 2001.
About half of the urban households in Karnataka
have access to drinking water within the
premises, which is below the national average
of 65.4 per cent. A third of households in
Karnataka have access to drinking water outside
the premises which is lower than 41.3 per cent
in Tamil Nadu but higher than Kerala (13.6
per cent), Gujarat (20.0 per cent) and Maharashtra

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

(21.1 per cent). In Karnataka 13.8 per cent of
households have access to drinking water away
from the premises, which is the highest among
the southern states (Table 7.6). The source-wise
data reveals that taps constitute the major source
of drinking water in urban Karnataka (78.4
per cent), which is higher than the national
average of 68.7 per cent. Maharashtra leads
with 89.2 per cent followed by Gujarat (83.0
per cent) (Table 7.7).
Across districts, in Koppal only 27.0 per cent of
households have access to drinking water within
the premises followed by Raichur (33.0 per cent),
Gadag (34.0 per cent), Bagalkot and Bellary
(36.0 per cent). Certain districts such as Mysore
(91.0), Gadag (89.0), Hassan and Bellary (88.0),
Bangalore Urban, Chamarajnagar and Chitradurga
(87.0), Tumkur and Kolar (86.0), perform better
in terms of access to tap water than Bangalore
Rural (80.0). Bidar performs poorly, with only
59.0 per cent except for Udupi, Uttara Kannada
and Dakshina Kannada where well water is the
dominant source of drinking water. In both Bidar
and Dharwad, 4.0 per cent of urban households
depend on other sources like tanks, ponds, lakes,
rivers, canals and springs (Appendix Tables:
Series 9).
Urban local bodies in Karnataka comprise
six municipal corporations, 40 City Municipal
Councils (CMCs), 91 Town Municipal Councils
(TMCs) and 82 Town Panchayats. These bodies
are entrusted with the duty of managing
water supply and sanitation in urban areas. A
persistent charge levelled against urban areas
is that they appropriate the lion’s share of the
state’s resources in water supply and sanitation.
Certainly, urban households across the country,
have better access to drinking water and
sanitation facilities than their rural counterparts
(Tables 7.6, 7.7 and Appendix Tables: Series 9).
However, urban water supply and sanitation
has its own constraints and inequities.

Urban water supply
Water is essential to life and a vital natural
resource in economic activities, but lack of access
to adequate, safe drinking water at an affordable

Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation

Urban water supply is
inefficiently managed
with massive investments
being wasted. Most of
water squandering takes
place because of the
under-pricing of water.
In addition, excessive
use of water also causes
severe water pollution,
groundwater depletion
and soil degradation.

price has been a problem for most urban local
bodies (ULBs), especially its poorer residents.
Urban water supply is inefficiently managed
with massive investments being wasted. Most of
water squandering takes place because of the
under-pricing of water. In addition, excessive
use of water also causes severe water pollution,
groundwater depletion and soil degradation.
Moreover, water is distributed very unevenly (with
the southern parts of Karnataka at an advantage
over the relatively drier northern counterparts)3 in
the state and many villages and towns currently
face critical water shortages that undermine
human health and economic development.

from property tax realisations. This amount was
about Rs.1,000 lakh for 2002-03, resulting
in a net operating deficit of Rs.15,000 lakh.
This deficit is met through other revenue
(non-water related) of ULBs like property tax,
SFC devolutions and other grants/loans.

Most ULBs receive water only for a few hours on
alternate days. The reasons include limitations in
source availability, inefficient distribution networks,
erratic power supply and poor management
practices. Losses through retail distribution, illegal
connections and public fountains contribute to
a high level of ‘unaccounted for water’ (UFW).
Though accurate data is not available on UFW, the
estimates vary between 30 and 70 per cent for
most ULBs.

Piped water is also supplied through public
fountains (PFs) for local communities, typically
comprising the urban poor or where individual
household connections cannot be provided,
either for economic reasons or due to physical
constraints. There are an estimated 73,000 public
fountains in Karnataka (excluding Bangalore).
Water supply through public fountains is erratic
and is also contingent on availability of power.
Typically, water is supplied two or three times
a week for only a few hours. Water losses from
PFs are high due to improper water management
practices and faulty (leaking) taps and pipes. PFs
have also become a source for unauthorised access
to water for vendors, who exploit the potential for
commercial gains from sale of such water.

Consumption is not metered, except in Bangalore
Urban district, hence volumetric tariffs are not
levied in the state. Since the rationalisation of
tariffs, most ULBs charge a flat tariff of Rs.45
per household per month. The tariff structure
also prescribes a separate debt-servicing levy,
which is not implemented in practice. Compared
to the O&M expenses of Rs.206 crore incurred
in 2002-03, the revenue realisation from
water tariffs (including connection charges)
was Rs.4,600 lakh (about 22 per cent of O&M
expenses). Additional revenue support is also
available through apportionment of water cess

Compared to 84 per cent of towns in south Karnataka, 92
per cent of towns in north Karnataka suffer from inadequate
water supply (Report of High Power Committee for Redressal
of Regional Imbalances, 2002). The inadequacy of source
of water is also more acute in north Karnataka, given weak
monsoon activity in the region, especially in summer. Places
like Dharwad, Gulbarga, Bidar and Raichur actually are forced
to rely on containerised supply of water from other places to
meet their needs in summer. Coastal Karnataka and the Cauvery
region have adequate sources availability and relatively better
than other parts of the state.

Most ULBs did not/could not supply water in
accordance with design norms as of year-end
2001. Lpcd in individual ULBs vary over a wide
range. Thus, even though the calculated lpcd of
ULBs is high, the actual water availability is low.
Most ULBs have water supply on alternate days
and one or two hours per day.

Urban sanitation
Nearly 80 per cent of urban households in
Karnataka have bathrooms within the premises,
which is above the national average of 70.4
per cent. Over 75 per cent of urban households
have latrines within the premises in Karnataka
compared with 92.1 per cent in Kerala and 78.1
per cent in Andhra Pradesh. In Karnataka overall
drainage connectivity (80.9 per cent) is better than
the national average of 77.9 per cent. A high 91.1
per cent of households in Bangalore Urban district
have latrines while 66.5 per cent of households in
Gadag lack this facility (Appendix Tables: Series 9).
Among the four mahanagara palikas in Karnataka,
Bangalore city has the maximum households with
latrines (91.1 per cent) followed by Mysore with
89.7 per cent and Gulbarga has the least with

57.2 per cent. By and large, the towns of north
Karnataka have inadequate latrine facilities.

Distribution of main source of drinking water in urban slums
(Per cent)

Water supply and sanitation in urban
slums
Urban slums have high concentrations of poor
people living in very basic conditions in the middle
of affluence. Table 7.9 gives the distribution of
the main source of drinking water supply in
notified and non-notified slums in Karnataka, in
comparison with the all-India average.
As this table indicates, Karnataka’s performance
is better than the national average in terms of
access to water from a relatively efficient source
namely taps. Further, only 28 per cent slums in
Karnataka are water-logged during monsoon
(in both notified and non-notified slums) as
compared to the national average of 36 per
cent for notified slums and 54 per cent for nonnotified slums. This, again, shows that Karnataka
performs better than the national average in
terms of drainage facilities. However, 66 per cent
of notified slums in Karnataka have no latrines as
against the national average of 17 per cent. The
gap for non-notified slums between Karnataka
and the national average appears to be less with
Karnataka recording 53 per cent against the
Indian average of 51 per cent. Similarly, only
23 per cent of notified slums in Karnataka have
under ground drainage (UGD) facilities as against
the national average of 30 per cent. However, 24
per cent of non-notified slums in Karnataka have
UGD coverage as against the national average of
15 per cent.

funds released by government out of SFC grants.
The low allocation to the urban sector and lack of
timely availability of funds have partly contributed
to the sub-optimal service delivery of water and
sanitation services. The rural sector is slightly better
served in terms of fund flows. The Karnataka Urban
Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB)
estimates that Rs.4,79,699 lakh (approximately
US$ 1 billion) is required to enable ULBs to conform
to minimum design standards. In sum, Karnataka
has done well in the rural sector as far as drinking
water supply is concerned, but there are challenges
in the path to reaching accepted norms across all
districts. The biggest challenges are in the urban
sector, where complex issues of tariffs have to be
faced.

Housing, Water Supply and Sanitation

Tariff setting: efficiency in governance
The State Urban Drinking Water and Sanitation
Sector Policy states ‘The longer term objective is to
establish an appropriate cost recovery mechanism
through adequate tariff to ensure that revenues
cover operations and maintenance costs, debt
service plus a reasonable return on capital…
Tariff will be structured in a manner such as to
disincentives excessive consumption and wastage
of water, whilst ensuring at least a minimum “life
line” supply to the poor.’

Subsidies to drinking
water end up favouring
the rich disproportionably,
since they have more
ready access to public
water supplies.

168

There are typically two principal forms of water
subsidisation — grants and low-interest loans
— both found in Karnataka. With the estimated
investments for the sector very likely to grow,
since the unit costs of new water supplies will
double, and in some cases, even triple, compared
with the present systems, even before including
environmental costs, there is an urgent need to
efficiently manage the finances.This is particularly
critical as the real cost of water may soon be out
of reach for the economically weaker sections.
The initiatives in this regard include savings
from regularising illegal connections, savings
from improved efficiencies, contributions from
the users and higher charges, wherever feasible.
Many believe that water subsidies are necessary
for social purposes, in particular to support the
poor. In fact, subsidies to drinking water end up
favouring the rich disproportionably, since they
have more ready access to public water supplies.
The evidence reveals a vicious circle: when
services are heavily subsidised, their quality is
low and service expansion relatively slow because
of lack of resources and their inefficient use. The

consequences are that the rich benefit while the
poor still have relatively high water expenses.
At the same time, the health of the poor suffers
because of inefficient water services. Current
subsidies do not always reach the target groups
and require to be restructured.
It could be inferred that low water prices generally
do not benefit the poor. However, this does not
necessarily imply that water subsidies are bad
and should always be avoided. Instead, they must
target the (financing) needs of the poor more
cost-effectively. Governments may, for instance,
choose to provide subsidies for micro-credit in
order to ensure income access, or issue subsidised
water stamps for the poor or apply ‘life line’
water pricing (a low rate for a basic service level
and an increasing rate above). When carefully
implemented and targeted, such a reform of
water subsidies may very well improve the lot of
the poor.
Proper water policies and action plans are
needed to adequately address current and future
problems of water misuse, increasing scarcity and
pollution. It points to the need for demand-driven
water policies to complement the traditional
supply-oriented approach, to reallocate existing
water supplies, to encourage a more efficient use
and to ensure an equitable access. A key priority
is reallocation between various users. Reforms
of current pricing and incentive measures,
institutional changes, technical improvements
and education and information are all needed
to promote most sustainable forms of water
development and use.
