Demography, Health and Nutrition
Introduction
Good health is an invaluable asset for better
economic productivity, both at the individual and
national level, but above all, it is valued by those
who own it as a prerequisite for a better quality of
life and better standards of living. Sub-populations
who are at the highest risk from poor health and
its effects on longevity and morbidity are the poor,
women, the Scheduled Castes and ScheduledTribes.
The main reasons for the high level of vulnerability
of these sub-groups are, first, the inaccessibility of
healthcare, and second, their inability to spend on
healthcare interventions. Public healthcare systems
must, therefore, provide that critical barrier between
ill-health and the ones who are most vulnerable,
but here too, factors such as financing and efficiency
greatly influence the quality and coverage of public
healthcare services.
The health scenario in Karnataka today is a
combination of achievements and challenges.
Significant advances have taken place in health
and healthcare services over the past decade. A
brief review of the key demographic indicators that
offer a reliable overview of the status of health in
Karnataka suggest that the state’s performance is
much better than the all-India average.The state’s
population increased from 4.49 crore in 1991 to
5.27 crore in 2001. A comparison of the decadal
growth of population shows a significant decline
from 21 per cent between 1981-91 to 17.5
per cent in 1991-2001. Life expectancy at birth
has increased to about 66 years in 2001. Infant
and maternal mortality are among the most
reliable indicators for assessing health status, and
Karnataka’s performance here, as in reducing
neonatal mortality, child mortality and maternal
mortality rates – all of which show a downward
trend – is better than the aggregated figures for
the whole of India (Table 6.1). In fact, Karnataka
is well on its way to achieving the Tenth Plan
objective of reducing MMR to 2 per 1000 births
by 2007. Institutional deliveries now account for
51 per cent of total deliveries, compared with 34

per cent for all-India. Small pox has been
eradicated; the state is free from plague and
guinea worm and the incidence of polio has been
considerably reduced. A widespread infrastructure
of health and medical institutions comprising
primary health centres offering basic services to
state-of-the-art super-speciality hospitals with
a national, and even international reputation, is
now in place.
There are, however, some challenges which the state
will have to confront with aggressive strategies.
Rural-urban disparities, far from diminishing, have
only intensified: for example, the infant mortality
rate (IMR) is 64 in rural areas as compared with
24 in urban areas (2004). There are noticeable
regional disparities in spite of overall improvements
in the various health indicators. The five districts of
northeast Karnataka – Gulbarga, Bidar, Koppal,
Raichur and Bellary – and two districts of northwest
Karnataka – Bagalkot and Bijapur – have worse
health indicators than the rest of the state. The
health status of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes is
cause for serious reflection because it is so distanced
from the health status of the total population.
Under-nutrition among pregnant women and
infants continues to take its toll. The incidence
of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis,
malaria and intestinal infections is still relatively
high. Now the state must confront HIV/AIDS and
the very human issues it brings to the fore. Lifestylerelated ailments like diabetes, heart disease, and
cancer are also registering an unwelcome increase.
Certain preventable health problems continue to

Good health is an
invaluable asset for
better economic
productivity, both at the
individual and national
level, but above all, it is
valued by those who own
it as a prerequisite for a
better quality of life and
better standards of living.

survive stubbornly in geographical pockets and
specific population groups. Although the maternal
mortality rate has declined, it is still unacceptably
high for a developed state like Karnataka.

Private sector participation in provisioning
healthcare services is still predominantly an
urban-based phenomenon. Rural areas must rely
on state sponsored healthcare. Here again, it is
the poor who are the single largest constituency
for public healthcare. It is for these reasons that
this chapter will focus on public health services in
the state since private sector-managed healthcare
does not target the sub-populations who are most
at risk and have the least capacity to spend on
their health needs.

Population
According to the 2001 census, since 1951 the
population of Karnataka has increased two and

a half times to 52.73 million. It progressively
increased between 1951 and 1981 but registered
a decline in growth, for the first time, in the
decade 1981–1991 i.e. from 26.75 per cent to
21.12. It further declined to 17.5 per cent in the
decade 1991–2001. Two critical demographic
trends which are now becoming visible, are an
increase in the size of the working population
(15 to 59 years) and a decrease in the below
15 population – both of which have significant
policy implications. The first is a possible increase
in joblessness if the economy is unable to provide
employment for this large labour force; the
second is the greying of the population over the
next 25 years, which will trigger a need for social
security. While Karnataka’s population growth
during the preceding decade is less than all-India
(21 per cent), it is higher than the neighbouring
states of Kerala (9.4 per cent), Tamil Nadu
(11 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (13.9 per cent),
indicating how imperative it is for Karnataka to
sustain this decline in decennial growth.

the state. At the regional level, the CBR is higher
in both the Hyderabad Karnataka and the Bombay
Karnataka areas than in south Karnataka. All
districts have experienced a substantial decline in
the CDR during the last decade.The decline in CDR
is higher in Bombay Karnataka and Hyderabad
Karnataka than in south Karnataka, probably
because the northern districts had such high crude
death rates to start with.
This decline in the CBR and CDR has been achieved
through changes in several socio-economic
and demographic variables over time. Many of
these factors relate to women’s unequal status
in society and any improvement in the following
parameters translates into an improvement, not
just in the CBR and CDR, but in many other health
indicators as well: women’s age at marriage,
their education levels, their participation in the
non-agricultural sector and per capita income.
Increasingly, Karnataka, over the last decade, has
witnessed many significant changes that have
favourably impacted its demographic profile. The
proportion of urban population increased from
30.9 per cent to 34.0 per cent, female literacy
increased from 44.3 to 57 per cent, the female
work participation rate went up from 29.4 per cent
to 32.0 and per capita income increased
from Rs.6,739 (1990-91) to Rs.11,516
(2001-02). At the same time, the age at
marriage for females increased to about 20 years
and the proportion of married females in the
age group 15-44 declined to about 75 per cent.
In addition to these changes, the reduction in
mortality as well as fertility can be attributed to
an improvement in medical facilities at different
levels and stages, as there has been a considerable
expansion of health institutions and staff, in both
public and private sectors.

The increase in LEB has brought about a

the decline in CBR and CDR. This change in the
size of the aging population is reflected in the
emergence of various healthcare issues associated
with the elderly such as diabetes, heart disease,
diseases related to the nervous system and mental
health. With this greying of the population likely
to increase over the next decade, geriatric care
must become part of the focus of public healthcare
systems.

Morbidity
Morbidity rates are important determinants of
the health status of a population and provide
policy inputs to health planners. The NSS in its
52nd round on morbidity pattern has estimated
that about 4.4 per cent in rural population and
4 per cent in the urban population in the state were
ill during the period 15 days prior to the survey, i.e.
about 22 lakh persons are ill at any given point of
time, which is an indication of the magnitude of
the problem (Table 6.4). Increased morbidity levels
have an adverse effect on productivity, resulting in
chronic worker absenteeism, loss of person-days
and a reduction in income. The hardest hit are the
poor, who find their productivity levels falling at the
very moment that there are demands on their purse
to pay for treatment. Chronic bouts of illness or even
one episode can send a family over the poverty line
into indebtedness. NSS data throws light on the
reasons people give for not seeking treatment for
ill-health.The survey shows that the major reason is
that the ailment is not considered serious enough to
require attention.There have been some significant
changes between the two surveys, i.e. 1986-87
and 1995-96. Financial reasons gain in importance
as a reason for not taking treatment in rural areas

and both rural and urban areas report an increase
in awareness about health.
The NFHS, during its two rounds of surveys, provided
some valuable information on the prevalence of
some diseases. Between the two survey points
NFHS-1 and NFHS-2, the incidence of malaria
in the rural areas of Karnataka increased from
5 to 7.7 per 1,000 persons, while at the national
level, the incidence in rural areas recorded an
increase from 39 to 42.5 during the same period.
The incidence of malaria for the state as a whole
increased to about 21 during 2001 and declined to
about 10 during 2003. Areas with a high incidence
of malaria are Mangalore and Bellary along with the
project areas of the Upper Krishna Project (Almatti
and Narayanpura), which are highly susceptible.1
The prevalence of tuberculosis in Karnataka is about
3 per 1,000 persons in rural areas and 2.2 per
1,000 persons in urban areas (NFHS-2). However,
the overall increase was about 2.98 per cent during
1999–2003.2
The incidence of leprosy in Karnataka is low at
one per 1,000 persons and the latest data from
the National Leprosy Eradication Programme
reveals that the prevalence rate of leprosy in 2003
has further declined to 0.2 per 1,000 persons.
Leprosy is more prevalent in Gulbarga, Raichur,
Bellary, Koppal and Gadag, all north Karnataka
districts.

HIV/AIDS
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
is caused by the HIV virus, which weakens the
body’s immune system and leads to death through
secondary infections. The first case of full-blown
AIDS in Karnataka was detected in 1988. Since
then, the prevalence of HIV and AIDS has been
rising and is a cause for concern with 24,236 HIV
cases and 1,730 cases of AIDS being reported
from 1988 to 2003. During the same period, 189
AIDS-related deaths were recorded.

The increase of HIV cases has been alarming,
particularly during the last two years. The
rate of increase during 2001-02 was 55 per
cent and during 2002-03, it increased to
106.2 per cent. Currently an estimated five lakh
people are infected with HIV. Karnataka has put a
good reporting and monitoring system in place,
unlike most of the reportedly ‘symptom-free’
states. The objectives of the government’s policy
are to keep HIV prevalence below three per cent,
to reduce blood-borne transmission to less than
one per cent, to achieve condom usage in not
less than 90 per cent of high-risk groups and
to ensure that awareness is created about HIV/
AIDS. In 2004, the state established 40 voluntary
counselling and testing centres (VCTCs) at the
taluk level for the prevention and care.

significant decline of about 45 per cent, from 95
in 1971. At the national level, the decline in IMR
is about 62 per cent though the estimated level of
IMR at both points of time is higher than that of
Karnataka (Table 6.6).
The various rates of IMR and child mortality rate
(CMR) by residence (NFHS-1 and NFHS-2) are
presented in Table 6.7. There has been a decline of
about two infant deaths per 1000 live births each
year. However, the SRS data on IMR for Karnataka
prior to both surveys showed a faster decline during
1971–81. Rural mortality rates are significantly
higher than the urban rates. If two segments of
IMR, viz. neonatal and post-neonatal are separated,
it is clear that the proportion of neonatal deaths to
the total IMR has shown a three percentage points
increase between two surveys as against a decline
of three percentage points in post-neonatal deaths.

The objectives of the
government’s policy are
to keep HIV prevalence
below three per cent,
to reduce blood-borne
transmission to less than
one per cent, to achieve
condom usage in not less
than 90 per cent of highrisk groups and to ensure
that awareness is created
about HIV/AIDS.

A sizeable decline of about 61 per cent has occurred
in the urban post-neonatal death rate.

There is a correlation
between high IMR and
the low socio-economic
standing of families,
gender disparity, illiteracy
and lack of institutional
support.

During 2001-02 Dakshina Kannada district (44)
had the lowest IMR followed by Udupi, Bangalore
Urban and Shimoga (45).The district with the highest
IMR is Dharwad (69) followed by Bijapur, and
Gulbarga (67), Bidar and Gadag (66). All districts
with an IMR higher than the national average are
in north Karnataka. Overall, the southern districts
in Karnataka present the best scenario with an IMR
of 50 compared with Bombay Karnataka (59) and
Hyderabad Karnataka (60). Karnataka will have to
step up its efforts to catch up with states like Kerala
(10) and Tamil Nadu (44). Currently, only the best
performing district is on a par with the Tamil Nadu
aggregate.
There has also been a drop of about 20 per cent
in child mortality and in under-five mortality.
Data on differentials in infant and child mortality
is not easily available, either at state or district
level. Different surveys (which have limitations)
provide some information on districts. Data
provided by NFHS-2 on differentials is useful for
understanding the influences of factors related to
infant and child mortality.
There is a correlation between high IMR and
the low socio-economic standing of families,
gender disparity, illiteracy and lack of institutional
support. Contributory factors to infant mortality
range from low per capita income, under-

134

representation of women in the non-agriculture
sector, early marriage for women, female illiteracy,
under-nutrition of both the mother and foetus,
high CBR and CDR, poor access to antenatal care
(ANC), low birth weight, unsafe deliveries and
the inadequate reach of the services provided by
the healthcare system. Kolar, Bijapur, Bagalkot,
Dharwad, Haveri, Gadag, Bidar, Gulbarga, Koppal,
Chikmaglur, Hassan, Raichur, Uttara Kannada,
Mysore, Mandya and Kodagu have an IMR higher
than the state average. While most districts have
some or most of the pre-disposing factors for high
IMR mentioned above, it is indeed surprising to
find the relatively better developed districts such
as Hassan and Kodagu performing poorly.
Infant death can occur at 2 stages: neonatal
and post-neonatal. Neonatal deaths take
place during the first 4 weeks of life and
post-neonatal deaths occur between 1 to 12
months of age. The incidence of both neonatal
and post-neonatal mortality can be reduced
significantly if the appropriate measures are
taken in time. Timeliness is crucial. About 0.40
lakh neonatal deaths take place annually in the
state. About 80 per cent of total infant deaths in
urban areas and 69 per cent of total infant deaths
in rural areas are neonatal deaths. This is also a
period when mothers are vulnerable, as evidenced
by the fact that most maternal deaths occur in the
four week period after child birth. The majority of
neonatal deaths are caused by the mother’s own
health status (which is normally poor because
of under-nutrition) resulting in low birth weight,
premature birth, asphyxia, infectious diseases,
pneumonia, tetanus, diarrhoea combined with
lack of access to institutional services.
Mortality rates are higher among infants born to
mothers who are below 20 years and above 30
years of age. A clear association is evident between
IMR and birth intervals.The IMR is quite high (98.8)
when the duration of the birth interval is less than
24 months and decreases with an increase in the
interval between births, for example, IMR is 32.3
when the birth interval is 48 months and above.
Since neonatal mortality is lower when the birth
interval is more than 24 months and the age of
the mother is in the age group 20-29, one way of

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

reducing neonatal mortality is to encourage young
couples to space births. Currently, only a low five
per cent use spacing methods. Bangalore Urban,
Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Uttara Kannada
are the few districts where more than 10 per cent
of couples use spacing methods.
Infant and child mortality declines considerably
with increases in standards of living (Table 6.9).
The poor are caught in a cycle of low income and
ill-health, which are mutually self-reinforcing. The
poor cannot afford the costs of a nutritious diet
or antenatal and post-natal care, the absence of
which can result in high-risk pregnancies which

mean either indebtedness or maternal death. High
rates of female illiteracy have very adverse effects
on the survival of mothers and their children in
terms of women’s lack of awareness of nutrition
or postpartum care.
The causes of death in infancy are the same for
boys and girls. Slow foetal growth because of
malnutrition is the major cause of death and
accounts for 33 to 34 per cent of infant deaths.
Birth asphyxia and other respiratory conditions
account for 26 per cent of infant deaths among
boys and girls. In the age group 1-4 years, injury
and other accidents are a major cause of mortality

Slow foetal growth because
of malnutrition is the
major cause of death and
accounts for 33 to 34
per cent of infant deaths.

Maternal mortality is a
crucial indicator of both
women’s health and of
gender justice, raising as
it does, questions about
women’s lack of control
over their own bodies.

among both boys and girls. These answer for
19 per cent of deaths among boys and
21 per cent among girls.The second most common
cause of death is diseases of the respiratory system,
which are predominant among boys (13 per cent),
and intestinal infectious diseases among girls
(12 per cent). Tuberculosis causes more than
7 per cent of deaths among children.

Immunisation of children
Immunisation of children against six serious but
preventable diseases viz. tuberculosis, diphtheria,
pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis and measles is
an important instrument of child survival. The
136

state’s programme also includes administration
of five doses of Vitamin A for the prevention of
night blindness and iron folic acid solution for
iron supplementation. The reproductive and child
health (RCH) survey of Karnataka (1998-99)
shows that the coverage is satisfactory except in
some of the northern districts. The immunisation
coverage for the children has improved in 14
districts other than Belgaum, Hassan, Kodagu
and Kolar (RCH 2004). The desired objective
of complete coverage seems quite attainable
in some districts, but the performance in
some others, like Raichur, is disappointing
indeed.

Maternal mortality
Women’s health encompasses many areas of
concern but since most female deaths are caused
by child birth, maternal mortality is a crucial
indicator of both women’s health and of gender
justice, raising as it does, questions about women’s
lack of control over their own bodies.
The maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Karnataka
is 195, which is substantially lower than all-India
(407) (Table 6.11). Among the southern states,
Karnataka is better than Kerala (198) but
has a higher MMR than Tamil Nadu (79) and
Andhra Pradesh (159). The leading causes
of maternal deaths in Karnataka are sepsis
(33 per cent) haemorrhage (27 per cent), anaemia
(13.3 per cent) and abortion (7 per cent). Deaths
caused by haemorrhage and obstructed labour can
be prevented if good obstetric care is available at
all times, but since such facilities are available only
in big urban hospitals, many rural women cannot
access emergency services in time. Eclampsia is
another leading cause of maternal mortality, which
can be prevented through regular antenatal care.
Abortions should be performed only in hospitals
where proper facilities are available, but ignorance
or fear of detection propels many women into the
doors of unqualified abortionists. As in the case of
infant mortality, and indeed the two are intimately
inter-related, the causes of maternal mortality are
a mix of factors such as women’s lack of control
over their reproduction, poverty, under-nutrition,
illiteracy and lack of accessibility to both anteand post-natal care.

Maternal and child health
services
Maternal and child health (MCH) services are the
two major components of the reproductive and child
health (RCH) programme that is provided through
primary health centres (PHCs) and sub centres
in the rural areas of Karnataka. In urban areas,
maternal and child health services are available
in government hospitals, urban health centres,
hospitals and clinics operated by NGOs and various
private nursing homes and maternity homes. MCH
has several components, of which, antenatal care
and institutional deliveries are critical to ensuring
safe delivery and maternal survival.
As we saw earlier, reducing neonatal deaths,
which constitute nearly 70 per cent of infant
deaths, would bring down the IMR significantly
and position the state within reach of achieving
the MDGs in both infant and maternal mortality.
The government strategy combines community
healthcare with institutional healthcare. Primary
healthcare is mainly provided by health workers
(ANMs) and traditional birth attendants (dais) who
are required to visit the homes of pregnant women
to ensure adequate antenatal care and to ensure
early identification of problem pregnancies.

Antenatal care
The proportion of pregnant women receiving
antenatal care (ANC) increased by about 3
percentage points between two surveys. In urban

areas, this proportion has increased much more
significantly than in rural areas. The proportion
of pregnant women among Scheduled Tribes
receiving professional care has declined though
there has been an increase among Scheduled
Caste women. Antenatal examinations by doctors
have also increased (Table 6.12).
The main components of the government’s
antenatal care programme are supply of iron and
folic acid tablets, tetanus (TT) immunisation, and
three ANC visits. The RCH rapid household survey
during 1997-98 provides information about
district level ANC services (Table 6.13). Coverage
of pregnant women by a complete ANC package
comprising a minimum three ANC visits, at least
one TT injection and supply of IFA tablets, varied
from a high 88 per cent in Kodagu to 26 per cent
in Bellary with the state averaging 60 per cent.
In northern Karnataka, while the coverage by any
type of ANC is high, coverage by the complete ANC
package is alarmingly low. Women who do not
complete the full course do not get the protection
required to withstand anaemia and tetanus and
potential problems are not identified in time for
treatment. The situation is more serious when
data on full ANC services of 2002 is analysed. It
shows that while coverage by any type of ANC
service has improved, the percentage of women
receiving full ANC has declined. One inference is
that healthcare staff was not able to ensure that
women who initially utilised ANC services were

and sub-centres in the

motivated to complete the course. Possibly staff
failed to ensure full coverage for various reasons
ranging from lack of personnel to inadequate
supplies of drugs and diagnostic kits.

Institutional delivery
The second important focus of the reproductive and
child health (RCH) programme is safe delivery i.e.
delivery, should take place in hygienic conditions
and under the supervision of trained health
professionals. Safe deliveries are less likely to be
accessible to the rural poor and the Scheduled
Castes and Tribes for several reasons (Table 6.14).
There has been a considerable improvement in
the proportion of safe deliveries at the district
level though the number is low in northern
Karnataka. Women resort to home deliveries for
economic reasons primarily, although distance
from the health facility, customary practices and
lack of knowledge about the facilities available
are other reasons. The government has converted
400 primary health centres into 24-hour service
providers in 2005-06 to increase institutional
deliveries. This is a step in the right direction.

Family planning
The current contraceptive prevalence rate of 60
per cent is slightly higher than the all-India average,

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

which is 58.8 per cent. Female sterilisation (52.5
per cent) IUD (3.5 per cent) CC users (1.0 per cent)
and traditional methods (1.3 per cent) are the
principal methods. Male sterilisation is a low
0.7 per cent. The prevalence rate is highest in
Himachal Pradesh followed by West Bengal.
Women continue to bear a disproportionate share
of the responsibility for birth control although the
decision-making rarely rests with them. Among
districts, the prevalence rate varies from 39
per cent in Gulbarga to 75 per cent in Hassan.
Similarly, for spacing methods, Gulbarga records a
low prevalence rate of 0.9 per cent and Dakshina
Kannada records 11.4 per cent, which is not
satisfactory.

Nutrition
Nutrition is a significant determinant of good health
and the incidence of mal- and under-nutrition in
the community affects certain indicators such
as IMR and MMR adversely. For the poor, an
improvement in per capita income combined with
the availability of cheaper food is a step towards
ensuring higher levels of food consumption. The
status of nutrition is, however, also dependent
on food consumption patterns, which, in turn,
are shaped to a great degree by women’s status
relative to men. Custom dictates that women eat
least and last in the feeding order, followed closely
by children. Not surprisingly, the greatest levels of
poor nutrition occur among women and children.
An insufficient food intake and ignorance about
nutrition coupled with low immunity ensure that
the most vulnerable experience very fragile health.
In this context, the greatest changes can occur
only when there is an improvement in women’s
status and an enhancement of per capita food
availability.

Child nutrition
The NFHS-2 has examined the nutritional status
of children up to 3 years of age by weight-for-age,
height-for-age and weight-for-height. Children
who are more than -2SD below the reference
median on any of the indices are considered
to be undernourished and children who are
more than -3SD below the reference median
are considered to be severely undernourished.

classified as undernourished by selected
characteristics. About 44 per cent of children
below three years of age are underweight and
about 37 per cent are stunted. The proportion
of children who are severely undernourished is
about 17 per cent according to the weight-forage and about 16 per cent according to heightfor-age. These figures are lower than India. The
level of wasting (weight-for-height) is about
20 per cent, which is higher than all-India (16
per cent). Girls are more underweight and stunted
than boys while boys are more waisted. Undernourishment is considerably higher among rural
children and among SC and ST children. The
importance of female education is flagged by
the fact that the children of illiterate mothers
are more undernourished than the children
of literate mothers and that the proportion of
undernourished children declines sharply with
an increase in the living standards of parents.
In 1998-99, the weight-for-age index
(a composite measure of chronic and acute
under-nutrition) showed that 43.9 per cent
of children below 3 years of age were underweight. This proportion is the highest among
the southern states though lower than all-India.
With regard to the height-for-age index
36.6 per cent of children below 3 years are
undernourished. Andhra Pradesh has the highest
proportion of undernourished children with 38.6
per cent while Kerala and Tamil Nadu have lower
proportions. According to the weight-for-height

The greatest changes can

index 20 per cent of children, below 3 years are
undernourished, the highest among southern
states and above all-India as well (Table 6.16).
The National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau, in its
Rural Survey 2004 has more current information
on the nutritional status of rural children and
women of Karnataka. Table 6.17 presents the
proportion of children in the age group 1–5 years
according to three anthropometric measures.
It is thus clear that the nutritional profile of rural
children has improved over the last five years.
However, the height-for-age factor remains a
matter of concern. The average intake of food
(gm/day) for children (rural) also shows a
somewhat even distribution and a varied diet
(Table 6.18). Children are not consuming
enough protein as the proportion of children with
‘protein-calorie adequacy’ is 23.3 per cent of
the children in the age group 1-3 years and
31.6 per cent of the children in the age group 4-6
years. However, the scenario in Karnataka is better
than Tamil Nadu and Kerala for corresponding age
groups (NNMB, Rural Survey, 2004).

Anaemia in children
Anaemia has serious implications for children’s
mental and physical growth as well as making
them vulnerable to infectious diseases. The
high-risk group is children aged 6–24 months.
The level of anaemia for children age 6 to 35
months as measured in NFHS-2 (Karnataka)
shows that about 71 per cent of children have
some level of anaemia: 20 per cent are mildly
anaemic, 43 per cent are moderately anaemic
and 8 per cent are severely anaemic. Mainly,
boys, children in rural areas and SC and ST
children have high levels of anaemia (Table
6.19). The level of anaemia among children in
Karnataka is lower than in Andhra Pradesh and
all-India (Table 6.20).

Demography, Health and Nutrition

Women’s nutrition

About 42 per cent of
women in the reproductive
age are anaemic. All age
groups are uniformly
affected, with a slightly
higher prevalence in
younger ages, which is
a matter of concern, as
they constitute the largest
proportion of the fertile
population among women
in the state.

The consumption of a varied and nutritious diet is
crucial for the health of all people but particularly
for women in the reproductive age. For a
balanced diet adequate quantities of protein, fat,
carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins are required
and these are found in meat, fish, egg, milk, pulses,
cereals, vegetables and fruit. NFHS-2 data on the
consumption pattern among married women
(Table 6.21) shows that a majority consume
pulses and milk/curd at least once a week. More
than 90 per cent eat vegetables once a week and
about 54 per cent eat fruit at least once a week.
Women in urban areas consume a greater variety
of food items than rural women. The consumption
of all food items is relatively low among SC and
ST women. Women with a high standard of living
inevitably have the highest consumption of all
food items.
The nutritional status of the ever married
women is expressed through body mass index
(BMI). The BMI is the product of weight in
kilograms divided by squared height in metres
and expressed as (kg/m2). The cut-off point for
height, below which a woman can be identified
as nutritionally at risk, is in the range of 140-150
cm. The average height of women in Karnataka
is 152 centimetres (one cm taller than the
all-India average). The mean height for women

in Karnataka varies slightly among different
groups and only about 10 per cent are under
145 centimetres in height.
The mean BMI for women in Karnataka is 20 and
varies within a small margin of 19-23 in different
groups. About 39 per cent of women have a
BMI below 18.5 indicating a high prevalence
of nutritional deficiency. Nutritional deficiency is
higher among women who are from rural areas,
illiterate, low income and among SCs and STs.
(Table 6.22).
The percentage of women with BMI below the
norm is 38.8 in Karnataka as compared to 35.8
per cent for all-India. A comparison with the
southern states shows that Karnataka has the
highest proportion of women with BMI below the
norm (Table 6.23).

Anaemia among women
Given the inadequacy of their diet, iron deficiency
anaemia is widely prevalent among the ever
married women in the age group 15-49. About
42 per cent of women in the reproductive age are
anaemic. All age groups are uniformly affected,
with a slightly higher prevalence in younger ages,
which is a matter of concern, as they constitute
the largest proportion of the fertile population
among women in the state. In order of severity,

about 27 per cent are mildly anaemic, about 13
per cent are moderately anaemic and a little over
two per cent are severely anaemic. Women living
in urban areas have significantly lower levels of
all grades of anaemia compared to women in
rural areas. This may be an important pointer to
the levels of poor hygienic and environmental
sanitation in rural areas leading to a high
prevalence of intestinal worm infection. Women
from the SC and ST communities have a higher
prevalence of anaemia.
The proportion of anaemia among women in
Karnataka (42.4) is lower than all-India. Andhra
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have a higher prevalence
of anaemia than Karnataka (Table 6.25).

Birth weight
The weight of an infant at birth is an important
measure of the nutritional status of the mother
and an indicator of the child’s survival rate.
An infant with birth weight less than 2,500
grams is at high risk. It is also probable that
mothers with poor nutritional status will deliver
low-weight babies. The RCH survey data on
birth weight observed that about 20 per cent of
the infants were below 2,500 grams. In many
districts more than one-fifth of the infants were
reportedly under-weight. The lowest proportion
of under-weight babies was in Bangalore Urban
(9 per cent) and the highest in Dharwad district
(39 per cent). More than half of the districts had
more than 20 per cent under weight babies,

Public expenditure on
healthcare

State interventions in nutrition

Despite the importance of public healthcare
services to the poor who are its primary clients,
expenditure on health and family welfare in
Karnataka has not increased over the years and,
in reality, it marginally declined from about one
per cent of GSDP in 1990-91 to about 0.88
per cent of GSDP in 2002-03. It is apparent
that family welfare is not receiving adequate
budgetary support: medical and public health
expenditure grew by about 26 per cent, family
welfare expenditure increased by only 10 per cent
with two negative growth years during 1998-99
and 2002-03.

The Centre-state co-financed Integrated Child
Development Scheme (ICDS) was launched in
the country in 1975 on an experimental basis
in 33 blocks, one of which was T. Narsipura of
Mysore district (Karnataka). The scheme has
multiple objectives of which the improvement
of the nutrition and health of children (0-6
years), pregnant women and nursing mothers
is a significant component. There are now 185

Within medical and public health, there has been
an increase in the share of expenditure of urban
health services, rural health services and medical
education, training and research (Figure 6.1). The
share of urban health services in medical and
public health has increased from 38 per cent in
1990-91 to 44 per cent in 2002-03. The share

ICDS projects in the state. Self-sufficiency in
food production in a country will not reduce
malnutrition among the poor particularly among
children and women unless food is available
at affordable prices. The Public Distribution
System (PDS) ensures that food grain procured
and stocked by the Food Corporation of India is
distributed to state governments for distribution
through fair price shops. In 2004, the Karnataka
government introduced the distribution of 10
kilograms of rice and wheat at Rs.3 per kg to
each yellow cardholder. While this intervention
will have a considerable impact on the diet of the
poor, it must be matched by building nutrition
awareness so that people can supplement their
diets with nutritious, locally available, vegetables
and fruits. Akshara Dasoha, the midday meals
programme for school children, which was
introduced in the seven educationally backward
districts of north Karnataka in 2002-03,
and was subsequently upscaled to cover the
entire state in 2003-04, is a major initiative
which will substantially enhance young children’s
nutrition levels.

health increased from about one per cent to only
about three per cent, which is low, given the
gap between rural and urban health outcomes.
Expenditure on medical education, training and
research increased from about 11 per cent in
1990-91 to 15 per cent in 2002-03. Overall,
however, there has been a decline in expenditure
on public health during the decade. The share of
public health in the budget has declined from
around nine per cent in 1990-91 to about six per
cent in 2001-02 (Figure 6.1).

While the expenditure on primary healthcare
has remained stagnant, tertiary healthcare is
increasingly getting a bigger share of resources.
This trend is unfortunate since investment in
primary healthcare represents better value for
money than spending on secondary and tertiary
facilities. Primary healthcare constitutes a social
priority sector as it targets rural areas and the
poor who cannot afford expensive private medical
care. The overall status in primary healthcare
expenditure is reflected in the state’s performance
with regard to several health indicators.
The financial statement of the Department of
Health and Family Welfare (excluding Medical
Education, Training and Research) provided in the
‘Departmental Medium Term Fiscal Plan’ (DMTFP)
shows that in 2001-02, about 69 per cent of the
revenue expenditure was employee-related and
towards transfer payments. Employee-related
expenditure constituted about 31 per cent and
transfer payments about 38 per cent of revenue
expenditure in 2001-02 (Table 6.26). This
classification underestimates the expenditure
related to employees because assistance to local
bodies, a substantial part of which is salary, is
included in transfer payments. As little as 19.55
per cent was spent on supplies, services and
maintenance all of which are important inputs
for improving the quality of services and ensuring
optimal outreach and efficient delivery.
In 2002-03, about 32 per cent of the total
expenditure on medical and public health was
spent through local bodies. Districts with poor
health indicators such as Belgaum, Dharwad,
Raichur and Koppal often receive less financial

Yashaswini health insurance for farmers
Yashaswini, a cooperative farmers’ healthcare scheme is a landmark initiative of the Karnataka
government. Launched in June 2003, the scheme has for the first time, addressed the major
health concerns of rural people who typically have no health insurance. A farmer who has been
a member of a co-operative society for at least 6 months can avail of the benefits of the scheme
by paying a nominal premium of Rs.60 per annum. The spouse and children are also eligible
to get benefits if they pay a premium of Rs.60 per person.
Beneficiaries under this scheme can approach a pre-identified network hospital for treatment.
The network hospital extends free out-patient services and diagnostic tests at concessional
rates. If surgery is required, then the network hospital takes necessary steps. The beneficiary
need not pay for surgery if the cost is below Rs.1.00 lakh for a single surgery and below
Rs.2.00 lakh for multiple surgeries. The network hospital gets its fees from the Yashaswini
Trust through the Family Health Plan Limited which is the implementing agency for this
scheme.
Under the scheme, so far over 1,600 surgical procedures costing up to Rs.1.00 lakh for a
single surgery and Rs.2.00 lakh for multiple surgeries are free for members. In the first phase,
16.01 lakh farmers enrolled as members and over 20 lakh farmers enrolled in the second
phase. 164 network hospitals have been identified all over the state under this programme.
About 1.10 lakh farmers have used the services provided under this scheme. About 86,000
free out-patient consultations and 24,122 surgeries have been conducted during 2003-04 and
2004-05. A payment of about Rs.28.56 crore has been made to network hospitals as fees for
cost of treatment.

Universal Health Insurance Scheme
The Universal Health Insurance Scheme (UHIS) is a Government of India programme
to provide health insurance cover to population below poverty line. Under this
programme any individual or a family of 5 or 7 members belonging to below poverty line
category can subscribe by paying an annual premium of Rs.365, Rs.548 and Rs.730
which Govt. of India subsidises by Rs.200, Rs.300 and Rs.400 respectively. From
2005-06, the Government of Karnataka will pay an additional subsidy of Rs.150, Rs.200 and
Rs.250 under this programme. This reduces the premium payable to Rs.15, Rs.48 and Rs.80
respectively. Initially the state government will cover 2.5 lakh SC/ST families who are members
of Stree Shakti self-help groups.
The beneficiaries of this scheme will get an insurance cover of Rs.30,000 for the whole year
for certain ailments excluding pre-existing diseases and delivery in case of expectant mothers.
United Insurance Company is the nodal implementing agency of this scheme.

assistance than districts with good indicators such
as Chikmaglur, Kodagu and Uttara Kannada. This
disparity indicates that equitable and consistent
norms for allocating funds to Zilla Panchayats
must form the basis of devolution of funds.
Despite the decreasing trend in outlays for financing
healthcare, Karnataka ranks third among major
states in its health expenditure (Table 6.27). This
suggests that overall, most states do not provide
adequately for health. A matter of concern is the
fact that Karnataka has lower health indicators
than some states that are spending less and the
question of targeting expenditure to regions/
districts and vulnerable sub-populations needs to
be seriously addressed by government.

Government health
infrastructure
Over time, Karnataka has seen considerable
expansion in health infrastructure in terms of both
trained professionals and institutions. Between
1985 and 2003, the number of primary health
centres (PHCs) increased from 365 to 1,696,
sub-centres increased from 4,964 to 8,143 and
community health centres (CHCs) from 27 to 253.
However, this expansion was not evenly distributed
across the state as is evident from the institution
and population ratio. The rural population covered
by a PHC is about 30,000 (20,000 in hilly and
tribal areas) and by a sub-centre, about 5,000
(3,000 in hilly and tribal areas). The region-wise
distribution reveals that south Karnataka has a
better ratio than either the Bombay Karnataka or
Hyderabad Karnataka regions. This is also true of
the bed–population ratio. Sub-centre population
coverage in Hyderabad Karnataka is about 32
per cent less than south Karnataka and 27 per cent
below Bombay Karnataka. The corresponding
figures in terms of the PHC population ratio are 26
per cent and 16 per cent less than south Karnataka
and Bombay Karnataka respectively. With
reference to the bed–population, infrastructure
in Bombay Karnataka region is 37 per cent and
in Hyderabad Karnataka, 30 per cent less than
southern Karnataka. The doctor–population ratio
is 1:3240 and doctor patient ratio is 1:2167
showing an improvement over 1985 (Table 6.28).
The expansion of coverage of health infrastructure

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005

facilities is an important step in the provisioning of
an efficient healthcare delivery system. It should
be supported by providing adequate drugs and
equipment, maintaining institutions, and ensuring
that health personnel are accountable to the
people they serve. A more equitable distribution
of institutions is also very necessary to bridge
regional disparities in health and nutrition levels.
The bed–population ratio (public and private) is
lowest in Kerala (382) followed by Tamil Nadu
(1,120), Karnataka (1,209) and Andhra Pradesh
(2,536). There are more than 35,000 sanctioned
posts of doctors, technicians and para-medical
staff of which about 25,500 have been filled. The
government has taken steps since the early 1990s
to ensure that all vacancies in the cadre of doctors
and nurses are filled, even resorting to local
contract appointments to ensure that vacancies in
the northern and malnad districts are filled (Table
6.29). Currently about 10.5 per cent of the posts
of medical officers are vacant and districts with
a high number of vacancies are Uttara Kannada
(24 per cent), Kodagu (21 per cent), Raichur
(20.7 per cent) and Chikmaglur (20.5 per cent).
In most of the northern districts vacancies of
doctors are above the state average. Doctors and
other trained para-medical staff are reluctant to
work in north Karnataka districts like Raichur and
Gulbarga or in the malnad districts of Kodagu
and Chikmaglur, preferring the more salubrious
climate of Bangalore-Mysore. The number of
vacancies in the cadre of female health assistants
is also rather high. Coupled with absenteeism this
leads to a scenario where institutions function at
below capacity levels and are unable to fulfil local
needs. Institutional deliveries require that doctors
and nurses be available at all times to deal with
possible emergencies. Kodagu and Chikmaglur,
which have good HDIs, for instance have an IMR
above the state average, which can be partly
attributed to lack of staff.

Public–private participation
Karnataka has initiated several measures to
ensure greater community participation in the
management of healthcare. The government
has constituted Arogya Raksha Samithis in
district and taluk hospitals to oversee hospital

BOX 6.5

Round-the-clock nursing services
In a major move towards reducing infant and maternal mortality, Karnataka has decided to
provide round the-clock nursing services at the primary health centre level. This service will
ensure more institutional deliveries and improved care of newborn babies. Government has
identified 399 primary health centres in 39 most backward taluks of the state where this new
programme will be piloted.

Public–private partnership
Under the public–private initiative in the state, so far 80 primary health centres have been identified and 28
have been assigned to private medical colleges and NGOs for complete management and it is now proposed
to assign another 100 primary health centres during the current year. Under this scheme NGOs and private
medical colleges can appoint their own staff to run these centres. Internal evaluation of this arrangement has
shown that there has been considerable improvement in the management of these primary health centres.

maintenance and decide how to use the money
collected as user charges. In another innovative
step, the Health department has mobilised
the support of self-help groups (such as
Stree Shakti groups) to spread awareness about
basic healthcare and to distribute medicines for
common ailments. The management of 28 PHCs
has been transferred to NGOs and private medical
colleges and government provides 75 per cent of
the total expenditure as financial support. This
is an important step towards promoting private
participation in healthcare meant for the poor.
The management of the Rajiv Gandhi super
speciality hospital in Raichur has been entrusted
to Apollo hospitals for 10 years. The Karnataka
Health Promotion Trust is funded by the Bill Gates
Foundation for focused attention on the control of
HIV/AIDS and rehabilitation of patients.

shows that there is greater dependency on private
healthcare services rather than on government for
non-hospitalised treatment (i.e. outpatient care)
in both rural and urban areas for all southern
states and all-India. Among the southern states,
rural Kerala has the highest proportion of cases
treated in government hospitals followed by rural
Karnataka. In urban areas, however, the number of
cases treated in government healthcare facilities is
the lowest in Karnataka across all southern states
as well as all-India (Table 6.30).

Private sector and healthcare

NFHS 2 data shows that utilisation of public health
facilities and institutions for child delivery is highest
(78.2 per cent) for women with low and middle
standards of living. Utilisation of private healthcare
facilities by SCs and STs is also very low. There
cannot be a better indicator of the primacy of the
state’s healthcare systems as the most favoured
provider of healthcare for the poor.

The healthcare services provided by the private and
corporate sector are largely concentrated in urban
areas. Despite this constraint, data (NSSO survey)

Private sector healthcare is a mixed scenario, with
high-tech speciality hospitals coexisting with seedy

clinics run by quacks. The services available to the
poor and marginal groups in private health facilities
may not necessarily be superior to what public
healthcare offers but it has certain advantages for
users. Public healthcare is often associated with lack
of staff, medicines and equipment. Above all, there
is chronic absenteeism among providers and rent
seeking. Private healthcare may end up sending the
poor into debt, but its merit lies in being available
when needed. Improved governance will certainly
result in better utilisation of public health facilities
by those for whom it was designed.

Tele-medicine project
The Karnataka Tele-medicine Project is a joint venture of the Indian Space Research Organisation
(ISRO) and the Government of Karnataka to provide expert medical services to rural and remote
areas. Hospitals/health centres in remote areas are linked via INSAT satellites with super
speciality hospitals thus providing patients in rural/remote places with access to specialist
doctors for consultation and referral services.
The tele-medicine system consists of customised medical software integrated with computer
hardware, along with diagnostic instruments connected to VSAT at each location.
The project was started on a pilot basis wherein Chamarajnagar district hospital and Vivekananda
Memorial Hospital (an NGO-run rural health unit) at Saragur in H.D. Kote taluk, Mysore district
were linked with Narayana Hrudayalaya, Bangalore.

Achieving the objectives of
Vision 2020
The foregoing analysis of population, health and
nutrition provides a reasonably bright picture of
achievements. The various strategies of the state
have had a positive impact on health as reflected in
the fact that most of the health indicators are above
the all-India average. Disparities between regions,
men and women, and between social groups have
also narrowed. Although the state must now focus on
matching the performance of neighbours like Kerala,
it can be said that Karnataka is moving in the right
direction and the targeted level of achievements
in the Karnataka Vision 2020 document is likely
to be achieved if the tempo is enhanced through
increased financial outlays and sustained good
governance. Lack of adequate budgetary support
and a need to improve governance, especially at
the cutting edge are factors that impact critically on
health outcomes.

Tele-medicine is used for the following purposes:

Remote consultation;

Second opinion;

Interpretation services;

Continuing education and exchange of clinical information; and

Home care.
Karnataka’s tele-medicine project envisages linking of all district hospitals, hospitals run by trusts
as well as a few taluk level hospitals with super speciality hospitals such as Narayana Hrudayala,
Bangalore (Cardiology), Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology, Bangalore, St. John’s Medical College
hospital, Bangalore (Paediatrics), NIMHANS, Bangalore (Neurology), JSS Institute of Medical
Science, Mysore (Nephrology) and Samatvam Institute of Diabetology, Bangalore (Diabetics).
The Government is extending this project to 13 more districts and the remaining districts will be
covered in a phased manner.The government of Karnataka will provide the required personnel and
space for the project while ISRO will provide VSAT connection and equipment.



One crucial path to achieving the goals set out in
Vision 2020 lies in targeting disparities of region,
caste and gender.
 The Hyderabad Karnataka region, which
has poor health indicators compared with
other regions, is underserved in terms of
infrastructure and funding. Literacy rates
are low, the percentage of agricultural wage
labour is significantly large, and there is a
concentration of SC and ST populations.
Similarly, there are certain districts like
Bijapur in Bombay Karnataka, Chamrajnagar,
Kolar and Tumkur in south Karnataka, which
have levels of performance below their
regional average. These areas will need





strategies tailored to address the specificity
of their deficiency in health performance.
Sub-populations such as the Scheduled Castes
and Tribes have a very poor health profile
compared with the rest of the population.
Their CBR, CDR and IMR are worse than the
state average. Their utilisation of healthcare
facilities is also poor. Maximising coverage of
these vulnerable groups will have promising
outcomes.
Women should be a strong focus area
because so many health issues arise from
gender inequity and their lack of control over
their reproduction. High MMR and IMR and
insufficient nutrition point to the subordinate
and marginal status of women.
Enhancing health expenditure is critical to
improvements in healthcare services. Health

expenditure actually declined from 1 per cent
of GSDP in 1990-91 to 0.88 per cent in
2002-03. Expenditure on rural healthcare
must be stepped up since the most vulnerable
segment of the population resides here.
Expansion in medical and tertiary education
must not occur at the expense of primary
healthcare.
Population growth will have to come down
to about 1.0 per cent per year from the
current 1.7 per cent. This can be achieved by
reducing CBR to about 16 to begin with
(the target is 13), through family planning
and reducing CDR to less than 6 through
improved health. This would stabilise the
population.
Since more than 70 per cent of total
infant deaths occur at the neonatal



stage, interventions must focus on several
strategies to prevent neonatal deaths
through encouraging spacing methods
particularly in young couples and combining
community healthcare with institutional
facilities. The causes of neonatal deaths are
both exogenous and endogenous. Many are
preventable through early detection (e.g. low
birth weight, obstructed labour, asphyxia)
and immunisation, which is why full ANC of
the target population should be 100 per cent.
Filling up all vacancies of ANMs and medical
officers, training, orientation, and supervision
are essential.
Complete immunisation among children
below two years must be achieved in spite
of substantial investment. High-risk districts
such as Raichur, also have the least coverage

Karnataka Human Development Report 2005







and achievement of targets here will ensure
universal immunisation in the state.
High rates of MMR can be best minimised by
ensuring total ANC and universal coverage
by skilled birth assistants and institutional
obstetric care for problematic cases. Here
rural areas are most in need of attention
with a high 61.5 per cent of deliveries taking
place at home. More 24-hour facilities to
deal with medical emergencies will have to
be introduced.
The magnitude of under-nutrition and iron
deficiency in Karnataka, as revealed by recent
data squarely signals that nutrition is a major
health issue in the state.The targets for 2007
include reduction of severe malnutrition
among children from 6.2 per cent to 3 per cent
and moderate malnutrition from 45 per cent
to 30 per cent, and reduction in newborn
children with low birth weight from 35
per cent to 10 per cent. This ambitious
plan requires a proper strategy to promote
low-cost, nutritious diets using locally
available food to supplement food security
through the PDS while poverty reduction
programmes add to people’s income. The
impact of the ICDS has been diluted by its
inability to target high-risk cases.
The quality of healthcare services seems
to be on the decline as reflected by the









low ANC coverage and the fact that only
50 per cent of deliveries are institutional
deliveries. Public healthcare will have to
improve quality by ensuring that all staff is
in place especially in regions/districts with
high IMR and MMR, maintaining buildings
and equipment and ensuring an adequate
supply of medicines.
Good governance in health means that service
providers will function in a transparent and
responsible manner. Absenteeism and graft
must be dealt with firmly.
Public health programmes in the state
have not yet managed to control diseases
like malaria, tuberculosis, jaundice,
gastroenteritis, and the incidence of some
of these diseases has risen in recent times.
Better sanitation and a protected source of
drinking water are critical inputs.
Data on morbidity is grossly deficient and
data on morbidity at all health facilities
should be compiled at district level.
District-wise data on MMR and IMR are not
readily available.
Gram panchayats should be involved in
managing healthcare by developing a set of
village level indicators that can be monitored
regularly. Containing HIV/AIDs will require
strenuous efforts from local bodies and
communities.
